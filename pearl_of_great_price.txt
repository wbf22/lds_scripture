4. And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore

hands ;»* but not all, for my works are without end,®

wondered. 

9. And the presence of God^ withdrew from 
Moses, that his glory was not upon Moses ;^ and 
Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left 
unto himself, he fell unto the earth.** 

10. And it came to pass that it was for the 
space of many hours before Moses did again receive 
his natural strength like unto man; and he said 
unto himself : Now, for this cause I know that man 
is nothing,^ which thing I never had supposed. 

11. But now mine own eyes have beheld God;^ 
but not my natural,^ but my spiritual eyes, for 
my natural eyes could not have beheld f for I 
should have withered and died in his presence/ 
but his glory was upon me;*' and I beheld his face,* 
for I was transfigured before hina.* 

12. And it came to pass that when Moses had 
said these words, behold, Satan^' came tempting* him, 
saying : Moses, son of man,^ worship me."* 

13. And it came to pass that Moses looked 
upon Satan'* and said: Who art thou? For behold, 
I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only 
Begotten ;&lt;&gt; and where is thy glory, that I should 
worship thee?

strengthened before him.« But I can look upon thee 
in the natural man/ Is it not so, surely ? 

15. Blessed be the name of my God, for his 
Spirit* hath not altogether withdrawn from me, or 
else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? 
And I can judge between thee and God;* for God 
said unto me : Worship God, for him only shalt thou 
serve.^ 

16. Get thee hence,*' Satan; deceive me not; for 
God eaid unto me : Thou art after the similitude of 
mine Only Begotten.*^ 

17. And he also gave me commandments when 
he called unto me out of the burning bush,^ saying : 
Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten,*' 
and worship me. 

18. And again Moses said: I will not cease to 
call upon God, I have other things to inquire of 
him: for his glory has been upon me,^ wherefore T 
can judge between him and thee.** Depart hence,* 

. Satan. 

19. And now, when Moses had said these words, 
Satan cried with a loud voice, and rent upon the 
earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only 
Begotten,^ worship me.^ 

20. And it came to pass that Moses began to 
fear exceedingly ; and as he began to fear, he saw the 
bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, 
he received strength,^ and he commanded, saying: 
Depart from me,^ Satan, for this one God only will I 
worship,^ which is the God of glory.

21. And now Satan began to tremble^ and the 
earth shook ; and Moses received strength, and called 
upon God, saying : In the name of the Only Begotten,* 
depart hence,* Satan. 

22. And it came to pass that Satan cried with a 
loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing 
of teeth ;^ and he departed hence,* even from the 
presence of Moses, that he beheld him not. 

23. And now of this thing Moses bore record; but 
because of wickedness it is not had among the chil- 
dren of men.* 

24. And it came to pass that when Satan had 
departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted 
up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy 
Ghost,*^ which beareth record of the Father and the 
Son;» 

25. And calling upon the name of God, he beheld 
his glory again, for it was upon him f and he heard 
a voice,** saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the 
Almighty,^' have chosen** thee, and thou shalt be made 
stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy 
command as if thou wert God.* 

26. And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of 
thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from 
bondage,* even Israel my chosen.**

CHAPTER II « 

1. And it came to pass that the Lord spake^ 
unto Moses, saying: Behold, I reveal unto you con- 
cerning this Heaven, and this Earth; write the 
words which I speak.*^ I am the Beginning and the 
End,^ the Almighty God;^ by mine Only Begotten 
I created these things/ yea, in the beginning I 
created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou 
standest^ 

2. And the earth was without form, and void; 
and I caused darkness to come up upon the face of 
the deep ; and my Spirit moved upon the face of the 
water; for I am God. 

3. And I, God, said : Let there be light ; and there 
was light. , 

4. And I, God, saw the light; and that light was 
good.* And I, God, divided the light from the 
darkness. 

5. And I, God, called the light Day; and the 
darkness, I called Night ; and this I did by the word 
of my power,* and it was done as I spake; and the 
evening and the morning were the first day. 

6. And again, I, God, said : Let there be a firma- 
ment in the midst of the water, and it was so, even 
as I spake ; and I said : Let it divide the waters from 
the waters ; and it was done ;

ment, and it was so even as I spake. 

8. And I, God, called the firmament Heaven ; and 
the evening and the morning were the second day. 

9. And I, God, said: Let the water under the 
heaven be gathered together unto one place, and it 
was so; and I, God, said: Let there be dry land; 
and it was so. 

10. And I, God, called the dry land Earth; and 
the gathering together of the waters called I the 
Sea; and I, God, saw that all things which I had 
made were good.^ 

11. And I, God, said: Let the earth bring forth 
grass, the herb yielding seed, the fruit tree yielding 
fruit, after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, 
whose seed should be in itself upon the earth, and 
it was so even as I spake. 

12. And the earth brought forth grass, every 
herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding 
fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind ; 
and I, God, saw that all things which I had made 
were good;* 

13. And th^ evening and the morning were the 
third day. 

14. And I, God, said : Let there be lights in the 
firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from 
the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, 
and for days, and for years ; 

15. And let them be for lights in the firmament 
of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it 
was so. 

16. And I, God, made two great lights: the 
greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to 
rule the night, and the greater light was the sun, 
and the lesser light was the moon; and the stars 
also were made even according to my word.'

over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth 
upon the earth, wherein I grant life, there shall be 
given every clean herb for meat; and it was so, even 
as I spake.

things which I had made were finished, and I, God, 
saw that they were good.^ 

3. And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and 
sanctified it ; because that in it I had rested from all 
my work which I, God, had created and made. 

4. And now, behold, I say unto you, that these 
are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, 
when they were created, in the day that I, the Lord 
God, made the heaven and the earth. 

5. And every plant of the field before it was in 
the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. 
For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I 
have spoken, spiritually,^ before they were naturally 
upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, 
had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. 
And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of 
men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in 
heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh 
upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in 
the air; 

6. But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went 
up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole 
face of the ground. 

7. And I, the Lord God, formed man from the 
dust of the ground,® and breathed into his nostrils 
the breath of life;^ and man became a living soul,^ 
the first flesh upon the earth, the first man^ also; 
nevertheless, all things were before created; but 
spiritually were they created and made according to 
my word.*

8. And I, the Lord God, planted a garden east-

formed. 

9. And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, 
to grow every tree, naturally,* that is pleasant to the 
sight of man; and man could behold it. And it 
became also a living soul.* For it was spiritual in the 
day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere 
in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things 
which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw 
that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, 
planted the tree of life"* also in the midst of the 
garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and 
evil.** 

10. And I, the Lord God, caused a river to go 
out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence 
it was parted, and became into four heads. 

11. And I, the Lord God, called the name of the 
first Pison, and it compasseth the whole land of 
Havilah, where I, the Lord God, created much 
gold; 

12. And the gold of that land was good, and 
there was bdellium and the onyx stone. 

13. And the name of the second river was called 
Gihon; the same that compasseth the whole land of 
Ethiopia. 

14. And the name of the third river was Hidde- 
kel; that which goeth toward the east of Assyria. 
And the fourth river was the Euphrates.

but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.*

Begotten,** that it was not good that the man should 
be alone; wherefore, I will make an helpmeet for 
him.«^

formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the 
air; and commanded that they should come unto 
Adam, to see what he would call them; and they 
were also living souls ;^ for I, God, breathed into 
them the breath of life, and commanded that what- 
soever Adam called every living creature, that should 
be the name thereof. 

30. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to 
the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; 
but as for Adam, there was not found an helpmeet 
for him. 

21.«' And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep 
to fall upon Adam ; and he slept, and I took one of 
his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof ; 

22. And the rib which I, the Lord God, had 
taken from man, made I a woman, and brought her

Woman, because she was taken out of man.

would not hearken unto my voice.^ 

5S And now the serpenf* was more subtle than 
any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had 
made. 

6. And Satan put it into the heart of the ser- 
pent, (for he had drawn away many after him/) and 
he sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the 
mind of God, wherefore he sought to destroy the 
world. 

7. And he Said unto the woman : Yea, hath God 
said — Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 
(And he spake by the mouth of the serpent.) 

8. And the woman said unto the serpent: We 
may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden ; 

9. But of the fruit of the tree which thou behold- 
est in the midst of the garden, God hath said — 
Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest 
ye die.* 

10. And the serpent said unto the woman: Ye 
shall not surely die; 

11. For God doth know that in the day ye eat 
thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,** and ye shall 
be as Gods, knowing good and evil.*' 

12. And when the woman saw that the tree was 
good for food, and that it became pleasant to the 
eyes, and a tree to be desired to make her wise, she 
took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and also gave 
unto her husband with her, and he did eat.

selves from the presence of the Lord God amongst 
the trees of the garden. 

15. And I, the Lord God, called unto Adam, and 
said unto him: Where goest thou? 

16. And he said : I heard thy voice in the garden, 
and I was afraid, because I beheld that I was naked," 
and I hid myself. 

17. And I, the Lord God, said unto Adam: Who 
told thee thou wast naked ?^ Hast thou eaten of the 
tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst 
not eat, if so thou shouldst surely die ?^ 

18. And the man said: The woman thou gavest 
me, and commandedst that she should remain with 
me, she gave me of the fruit of the tree and I did 
eat.* 

19. And I, the Lord God, said unto the woman: 
What is this thing which thou hast done? And the 
woman said: The serpent beguiled me,^ and I 
did eat. 

20. And I, the Lord God, said unto the serpent : 
Because thou hast done this thou shalt be cursed 
above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; 
upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou 
eat all the days of thy life; 

21. And I will put enmity between thee and the 
woman, between thy seed and her seed ; and he shall 
bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.''

commandments of the Lord. 

6. And after many days an angeP of the Lord 
appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer 
sacrifices unto the Lord ? And Adam said unto him : 
I know not, save the Lord commanded me.* 

7. And then the angel spake, saying: This thing 
is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begot- 
ten^ of the Father, which is full of grace and 
truth." 

8. Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest 
in the name of the Son,® and thou shalt repenf* and 
call upon God in the name of the Son for evermore. 

9. And in that day the Holy Ghost^ fell upon 
Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the 
Son,** saying : I am the Only Begotten* of the Father 
from the beginning,* henceforth and for ever, that 
as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed," and 
all mankind, even as many as will.'' 

10. And in that day Adam blessed God and was 
filled, and began to prophesy"' concerning all the 
families of the earth, saying : Blessed be the name of 
God, for because of my transgression my eyes are 
opened,^ and in this life I shall have joy, and again 
in the flesh I shall see God.

should have known good and evil,^ and the joy of 
our redemption," and the eternal life which God 
giveth unto all the obedient.

13. And Satan^ came among them, saying: I am

Believe it not; and they believed it not, and they

from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and

15. And as many as believed in the Son, and 
repented of their sins, should be saved ;'^ and as many 
as believed not and repented not, should be damned ;* 
and the words went forth out of the mouth of God

not respect. Now Satan knew this, and it pleased 
him.* And Cain was very wroth, and his counte-

22. And the Lord said unto Cain: Why art thou 
wroth? Why is thy countenance fallen? 

23. If thou doest well, thou shalt be accepted. 
And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door, 
and Satan desireth to have thee; and except thou 
shalt hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver 
thee up, and it shall be unto thee according to his 
desire. And thou shalt rule over him ;

30. And Satan sware unto Cain that he would do 
according to his commands. And all these things 
were done in secret.**

and he gloried in his wickedness.

48. If Cain shall be avenged seven fold,® truly 
Lamech shall be seventy and seven fold;*

became Master Mahan,*' master of that great secret 
which was administered unto Cain by Satan; and 
Irad,"^ the son of Enoch, having known their secret, 
began to reveal it unto the sons of Adam; 

50. A\Tierefore Lamech, being angry, slew him, 
not like unto Cain his brother Abel,^' for the sake 
of getting gain, but he slew him for the oath's 
sake. 

51. For, from the days of Cain, there was a 
secret combination,^' and their works were in the dark, 
and they knew every man his brother. 

52. Wherefore the Lord cursed Lamech, and his 
house, and all them that had covenanted with Satan ;^ 
for they kept not the commandments of God, and it 
displeased God, and he ministered not unto them, 
and their works were abominations, and began to 
spread among all the sons of men.* 

53. And it was among the sons of men, and 
among the daughters of men these things were not

1. And it came to pass that Enoch continued 
his speech, saying: Behold, our father Adam taught 
these things, and many have believed and become 
the sons of God," and many have believed not, and 
have perished in their sins, and are looking forth 
with fear, in torment, for the fiery indignation of the 
wrath of God to be poured out upon them. 

2. And from that time forth Enoch began to 
prophesy,^ saying unto the people, that: As I was 
journe3ring, and stood upon the place Mahujah, and 
cried unto the Lord, there came a voice out of 
heaven,^ 8a3ring — ^Tum ye, and get ye upon the mount 
Simeon. 

3. And it came to pass that I turned and went 
up on the mount; and as I stood upon the mount, I 
beheld the heavens open, and I was clothed upon 
with glory ;^ 

4. And I saw the Lord f and he stood before my 
face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh 
one with another, face to face / and he said unto me : 
Look,^ and I will show unto thee the world for the 
space of many generations. 

5. And it came to pass that I beheld in the valley 
of Shum, and lo, a great people which dwelt in tents, 
which were the people of Shum.* 

6. And again the Lord said unto me : Look ; and 
I looked towards the north, and I beheld the people 
of Canaan,* which dwelt in tents. 

7. And the Ix)rd said unto me: Prophesy; and I 
prophesied, saying: Behold the people of Canaan, 
which are numerous, shall go forth in battle array

against the people of Shum, and shall slay them 
that they shall utterly be destroyed; and the people 
of Canaan shall divide themselves in the land, and 
the land shall be barren and unfruitful, and none 
other people shall dwell there but the people of 
Canaan ; 

8. For behold, the Lord shall curse the land with 
much heat, and the barrenness thereof shall go forth 
forever; and there was a blackness^ came upon all 
the children of Canaan,* and they were despised 
among all people. 

9. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto 
me: Look;' and I looked, and I beheld the land of 
Sharon, and the land of Enoch, and the land of 
Omner, and the land of Heni, and the land of Shem, 
and the land of Haner, and the land of Hanannihah, 
and all the inhabitants thereof; 

10. And the Lord said unto me : Go to this people, 
and say unto them — Repent,*" lest I come out and 
smite them with a curse, and they die. 

11. And he gave unto me a commandment that 
I should baptize** in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son,® which is full of grace and truth,** and of the 
Holy Ghost,* which bareth record'' of the Father 
and the Son. 

12. And it came to pass that Enoch continued to 
call upon all the people, save it were the people of 
Canaan,* to repent;* 

13. And so great was the faith of Enoch, that 
he led the people of God, and their enemies came 
to battle against them; and he spake the word of 
the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the moun- 
tains fled, even according to his command; and the 
rivers of water were turned out of their course;**

and the roar of the lions was heard out -of the wilder- 
ness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was 
the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of 
the language which God had given him.'' 

14. There also came up a land out of the depth 
of the sea, and so great was the fear of the enemies 
of the people of God, that they fled and stood afar 
off and went upon the land which came up out of the 
depth of the sea. 

15. And the giants of the land, also, stood afar 
off; and there went forth a curse upon all people that 
fought against God; 

16. And from that time forth there were war^i 
and bloodshed among them; but the Lord cam« 
and dwelt with his people,"' and they dwelt m 
righteousness.* 

17. The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, 
so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon 
his people. And the Lord blessed the land, and they 
were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high 
places, and did flourish. 

18. And the Lord called his people Zion.^ because 
they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt 
in righteousness; and there was no poor among 
them. 

19. And Enoch continued his preaching in right- 
eousness unto the people of God. And it came to pass 
in his days, that he built a city that was called the 
City of Holiness, even Zion.^ 

20. And it came to pass that Enoch talked** with 
the Lord; and he said unto the Lord: Surely Zion 
shall dwell in safety forever. But the Lord said 
unto Enoch: Zion have I blessed, but the residue of 
the people^ have I cursed.

unto Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth f and he 
beheld, and lo, Zion, in process of time, was taken 
up into heaven.** And the Lord said unto Enoch: 
Behold mine abode forever. 

22. And Enoch also beheld the residue of the 
people which were the sons of Adam ; and they were 
a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it were the 
seed of Cain, for the seed of Cain were black, and 
had not place among them. 

23. And after that Zion was taken up into heaven, 
Enoch beheld, and lo, all the nations of the earth 
were before him ;*' 

24. And there came generation upon generation \ 
and Enoch was high and lifted up, even in the 
bosom of the Father, and of the Son of Man/ and 
behold, the power of Satan was upon all the face of 
the earth. 

25. And he saw angels^' descending out of heaven ; 
and he heard a loud voice* saying: Wo, wo be unto 
the inhabitants of the earth. 

26. And he beheld Satan;* and he had a great 
chain in his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the 
earth with darkness ; and he looked up and laughed,^ 
and his angels rejoiced. 

27. And Enoch beheld angels descending out of 
heaven,* bearing testimony of the Father and Son '} 
and the Holy Ghost"* fell on many, and they were 
caught up by the powers of heaven into Zion.'* 

28. And it came to pass that the God of heaven 
looked upon the residue of the people,^ and he wept f

the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the

29. And Enoch said unto ilic T/)rd: IIow is it 
that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from 
all eternity to all eternity ?« 

30. And were it possible that man could number 
the particles of the earth, yea millions of earths like 
this, it would not be a beginning to the number of 
thy creations ;** and thy curtains are stretched out 
still ; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; 
and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind 
forever ; 

31. And thou hast taken Zion to thine own 
bosom,* from all thy creations, from all eternity to 
all eternity ; and nought but peace, justice, and truth 
is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go 
before thy face and have no end; how is it thou 
canst weep?* 

32. The Lord said** unto Enoch: Behold these 
thy brethren ; they are the workmanship of mine own 
hands,^ and I gave unto them their knowledge, in 
the day I created them ; and in the Garden of Eden,*^ 
gave I unto man his agency f 

33. And tmto thy brethren have I said, and also 
given commandment, that they should love one 
another, and that they should choose me, their 
Father ;^ but behold, they are without affection, and 
they hate their own blood;* 

34. And the fire of mine indignation is kindled 
against them ; and in my hot displeasure will I send 
in the floods** upon them, for my fierce anger is 
kindled against them.*

and hold all the creations which I have made; and 
mine eye can pierce them also, and among all tlie 
workmanship of mine hands*^ there has not been so 
great wickedness as among thy brethren. 

37. But behold, their sins shall be upon the heads 
of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and 
misery shall be their doom;^ and the whole heavens 
shall weep over them, even all the workmanship of 
mine hands ; wherefore should not the heavens weep,^' 
seeing these shall suffer? 

38. But behold, these which thine eyes are upon 
shall perish in the floods;^ and behold, I will shut 
them up ; a prison have I prepared for them.* 

39. And That which I have chosen hath plead 
before my face. Wherefore, he suffereth for their 
sins;^ inasmuch as they will repent in the day that 
my Chosen* shall return unto me, and until that day 
they shall be in torment ; 

40. Wherefore, for this shall the heavens weep,' 
yea, and all the workmanship of mine hands.*^ 

41. And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto 
Enoch,** and told Enoch all the doings of the children 
of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon 
their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and 
stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide 
as eternity ; and his bowels yearned ; and all eternity 
shook. 

42. And Enoch also saw N'oah^*' and his family; 
that the posterity of all the sons of Noah should be 
saved with a temporal salvation ; 

43. Wherefore Enoch saw that Noah built an 
ark f and that the Lord smiled upon it, and held it 
in his own hand ; but upon the residue of the wicked 
the floods^ came and swallowed them up.

44. And as Enoch saw this, he had bitterness of 
soul, and wepf* over his brethren, and said unto the 
heavens : I will refuse to be comforted ; but the Lord 
said* unto Enoch: Lift up your heart, and be glad; 
and look.* 

45. And it came to pass that Enoch looked; and 
from Noah, he beheld all the families of the earth ; 
and he cried unto the Lord, saying : When shall the 
day of the Lord come? When shall the blood of the 
Righteous be shed, that all they that mourn may be 
sanctified and have eternal lifer^ 

46. And the Lord said : It shall be in the meridian 
of time,'' in the days of wickedness and vengeance. 

47. And behold, Enoch saw the day of the coming 
of the Son of Man,"' even in the flesh f and his soul 
rejoiced, sa3ring : The Righteous is lifted up, and the 
Lamb is slain from the foundation of the world; and 
through faith I am in the bosom of the Father, 
and behold, Zion is with me.*' 

48. And it came to pass that Enoch looked upon 
the earth; and he heard a voice^ from the bowels 
thereof, saying: Wo, wo is me,* the mother of men; 
I am pained, I am weary, because of the wickedness 
of my children. When shall I rest,* and be cleansed 
from the filthiness which is gone forth out of me? 
When will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest, 
and righteousness for a season abide upon my 
face ? 

49. And when Enoch heard the earth mourn, he 
wept,^ and cried unto the Lord, saying : Lord, wilt 
thou not have compassion upon the earth? Wilt 
thou not bless the children of Noah? 

50. And it came to pass that Enoch continued

in the name of thine Only Begotten/ even Jesus 
Christ/ that thou wilt have- mercy upon Noah and 
his seed, that the earth might never more be covered 
by the floods. 

51. And the Lord could not withhold; and he 
covenanted with Enoch, and sware unto him with an 
©ath, that he would stay the floods; that he would 
call upon the children of Noah ; 

52. And he sent forth an unalterable decree, that 
a remnant of his seed should always be found among 
all nations, while the earth should stand ; 

53. And the Lord said: Blessed is he through 
whose seed Messiah shall come; for he saith — I am 
Messiah, the King of Zion, the Kock of Heaven, 
which is broad as eternity; whoso cometh in at the 
gate and climbeth up by me shall never fall ; where- 
fore, blessed are they of whom I have spoken^ for 
they shall come forth with songs of everlasting joy. 

54. And it came to pass that Enoch cried unto 
the Lord,^ saying : When the Son of Man^ cometh in 
the flesh,* shall the earth rest?^ I pray thee, show 
me these things. 

55. And the Lord said unto Enoch: Look;^ and 
he looked and beheld the Son of Man lifted up on 
the cross,* after the manner of men ; 

56. And he heard a loud voice ;^ and the heavens 
were veiled; and all the creations of God mourned; 
and the earth groaned;*^ and the rocks were rent; 
and the Saints arose, and were crowned at the right 
hand of the Son of Man,*^ with crowns of glory ; 

57. And as many of the spirits as were in prison^ 
came forth, and stood on the right hand of God;

and the remainder were reserved in chains of darkness 
until the judgment of the great day. 

58. And again Enoch wept^ and cried unto the 
Tjord, saying: AVhen shall the earth rest?^' 

59. And Enoch beheld the Son of Man ascend 
up unto t}\e Father; and he called unto the Lord, 
saying: Wilt thou not come again upon the earth? 
Forasmuch as thou art God, and 1 know thee, and 
thou hast sworn unto me,^ and commanded me that 
I should ask in the name of thine Only Begotten;* 
thou hast made me, and given unto me a right to thy 
throne, and not of myself, but through thine own 
grace; wherefore, I ask thee if thou wilt not come 
again on the earth. 

60. And the Lord said* unto Enoch: As I live, 
even so will I come in the last days, in the days of 
wickedness and vengeance, to fulfil the oath which 
I have made unto you" concerning the children of 
Noah ; 

61. And the day shall comethat the earth shall 
rest, but before that day the heavens shall be dark- 
ened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; 
and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth ; and 
great tribulations shall be among the children of 
men, but my people will I preserve; 

62. And righteousness will I send down out of 
heaven, and truth will I send forth out of the earth,^ 
to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten;**^ his 
resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the 
resurrection of all men; and righteousness and 
truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a 
flood, to gather out mine elect from the four quar- 
ters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, 
an Holy City, that my people may gird up their

ing; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be 
called Zion/ a New Jerusalem.^ 

63. And the Lord said unto Enoch: Then shalt 
thou and all thy city'^ meet them there, and we will 
receive them into our bosom, and they shall see us ; 
and we will fall upon their necks, and they shall 
fall upon our necks, and we will kiss each other ; 

64. And there shall be mine abode,^ and it shall 
be Zion, which shall come forth out of all the crea- 
tions which I have made; and for the space of a 
thousand years* the earth shall rest.^ 

65. And it came to pass that Enoch saw the day 
of the coming of the Son of Man,^ in the last days, 
to dwell on the earth in righteousness for the space 
of a thousand years ;^ 

66. But before that day he saw great tribulations 
among the wicked; and he also saw the sea, that it 
was troubled, and men's hearts failing them, looking 
forth with fear for the judgments of the Almighty 
God, which should come upon the wicked. 

67. And the Lord showed Enoch all things, even 
unto the end of the world; and he saw the day of 
the righteous, the hour of their redemption; and 
received a fulness of joy; 

68. And all the days of Zion,^ in the days of 
Enoch, were three hundred and sixty-five years. 

69. And Enoch and all his people walked with 
God,fi' and he dwelt in the midst of Zion; and it 
came to pass that Zion was not, for God received it 
up into his own bosom ; and from thence went forth 
the saying, Zion is Fled.*

11. And all the days of Lamech were seven hun- 
dred and seventy-seven years, and he died. 

12. And Noah was four hundred and fifty years 
old, and begat Japheth; and forty-two years after- 
ward he begat Shem of her who was the mother of 
Japheth, and when he was five hundred years old he 
begat Ham.fi' 

13. And Noah and his sons hearkened'^ unto the 
Lord, and gave heed, and they were called the sons 
of God.* 

14:J And when these men began to multiply on 
the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto 
them, the sons of men*' saw that those daughters 
were fair, and they took them wives,, even as they 
chose. 

15. And the Lord said' unto Noah: The daugh- 
ters of thy sons have sold themselves; for behold 
mine anger is kindled"* against the sons of men,** for 
they will not hearken^ to my voice. 

16. And it came to pass that Noah prophesied,** 
and taught the things of God, even as it was in the 
beginning. 

17.9 And the Lord said** unto Noah : My Spirit^ 
shall not always strive with man,* for he shall know 
tliat all flesh shall die ; yet his days shall be an hun- 
dred and twenty years; and if men do not repent," 
I will send in the floods^ upon them. 

18. And in those days there were giants on the 
earth,**^ and they sought Noah to take away his life ; 
but the Lord was with Noah, and the power of the 
Lord* was upon him.

19. And the Lord ordained^ Noah after his own 
order, and commanded him that he should go forth 
and declare his GospeP unto the children of men, 
even as it was given unto Enoch.*^ 

20. And it came to pass that Xoah called upon 
the children of men* that they should repent;^ but 
they hearkened not*^ unto his words ; 

21. And also, after that they had heard him, they 
came up before him, saying: Behold, we are the 
sons of God;^ have we not taken unto ourselves the 
daughters of men? And are we not eating and 
drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage? 
And our wives bear unto us children, and the same 
are mighty men, which are like unto men of old, 
men of great renown.^ And they hearkened not*' 
unto the words of Noah. 

22. And God saw that the wickedness of men 
had become great in the earth; and every man was 
lifted up in the imagination of the thoughts of his 
heart, being only evil continually.^ 

23. And it came to pass that Noah continued his 
preaching unto the people, saying: Hearken, and 
give heed unto my words ; 

24. Believe and repent* of your sins and be 
baptized^ in the name of Jesus Christ,* the Son of 
God,^ even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the 
Holy Ghost,*" that ye may have all things made 
manifest; and if ye do not this, the floods'* will 
come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened 
not.o

pained that the Lord had made man on the earth, 
and it grieved him at the heart.

both man and beast, and the creeping things, and 
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth Noah that I 
have created them, and that I have made them; and

his life.** 

27. And thus Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord;* for Noah was a just man, and perfect in his 
generation; and he walked with God,* as did also his 
three sons,** Shem, Ham, and Japheth.*' 

28. The earth was corrupt before God, and it was

1. In the land of the Chaldeans,^ at the resi- 
dence of my father, I, Abraham, saw that it was 
needful for me to obtain another place of residence ; 

2. And, finding there was greater happiness and 
peace and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of 
the fathers,^ and the right whereunto I should be 
ordained^ to administer the same; having been my- 
self a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be 
one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a 
greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a

instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, 
I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding the 
right belonging to the fathers.^ 

3. It was conferred upon me from the fathers; 
it came down from the fathers,^ from the beginning 
of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the 
foundations of the earth to the present time, even 
the right of the first-born, on the first man,^' who 
is Adam,'^ our first father, through the fathers, unto 
me. 

4. I sought for mine appointment unto the 
Priesthood* according to the appointment of God 
unto the fathers concerning the seed.^' 

5. My fathers having turned from their right- 
eousness, and from the holy commandments which 
the Lord their God had given unto them, unto the 
worshiping of the gods of the heathen,* utterly re- 
fused to hearken to my voice ; 

6. For their hearts were set to do evil, and were 
wholly turned to the god of Elkenah,^ and the god 
of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the 
god of Korash^ and the god of Pharaoh,** king of 
Egypt; 

7. Therefore they turned their hearts to the 
sacrifice of the heathen in offering up their children 
unto their dumb idols, and hearkened not unto my 
voice, but endeavored to take away my life** by the 
hand of the priest of Elkenah. The priest of Elke- 
nah was also the priest of Pharoah.** 

8. Now, at this time it was the custom of the 
priest of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to offer up 
upon the altar which was built in the land of Chal- 
dea, for the offering unto these strange gods, men, 
women, and children.

9. And it came to pass that the priest made an 
offering unto the god of Pharaoh,^ and also unto 
the god of Shagreel, even after the manner of 
the Egyptians. Now the god of Shagreel was the 
sun. 

10. Even the thank-offering of a child did the 
priest of Pharaoh offer upon the altar which stood 
by the hill called Potiphar^s Hill,« at the head of 
the plain of Olishem. 

11. Now, this priest had offered upon this altar 
three virgins*" at one time, who were the daughters 
of Onitah, one of the royal descent directly from 
the loins of Ham.* These virgins were offered up 
because of their virtue; they would not bow down 
to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they 
were killed upon this altar, and it was done after 
the manner of the Egyptians. 

12. And it came to pass that the priests laid 
violence upon me, that they might slay me also,* as 
they did those virgins** upon this altar ; and that you 
may have a knowledge of this altar, I will refer you 
to the representation at the commencement of this 
record. 

13. It was made after the form of a bedstead, 
such as was had among the Chaldeans,'^ and it stood 
before the gods of Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, 
Korash, and also a god like unto that of Pharaoh, 
king of Egypt.*^ 

14. That you may have an understanding of 
these gods, I have given you the fashion of them in 
the figures at the beginning, which manner of the 
figures is called by the Chaldeans, Rahleenos, which 
signifies hieroglyphics.

that they might offer me up and take away my life/ 
behold, I lifted up my voice unto the Lord my 
God/ and the Lord hearkened and heard, and he 
filled me with the vision of the Almighty, and the 
angel of his presence stood by me,^ and immediately 
unloosed my bands ; 

16. And his voice was unto me: Abraham, 
Abraham, behold, my name is Jehovah,* and I have 
heard thee, and have come down to deliver thee, 
and to take thee away from thy father^s house, and 
from all thy kins-folk, into a strange land which 
thou knowest not of ;^ 

17. And this because they have turned their 
hearts away from me, to worship the god^ of Elke- 
nah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mah- 
mackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of 
Pharaoh, king of Egypt; therefore I have come 
down to visit them, and to destroy him who hath 
lifted up his hand against thee, Abraham, my son, 
to take away thy lif e.^ 

18. Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I 
will take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the 
Priesthood^ of thy father, and my power shall be over 
thee.^ 

19. As it was with Noahs' so shall it be with 
thee; but through my ministry my name shall be 
known in the earth forever, for I am thy God. 

20. Behold, Potiphar's Hill'^ was in the land of 
Ur, of Chaldea.* And the Lord broke down the 
altar of Elkenah,^ and of the gods of the land, and 
utterly destroyed them, and smote the priest that 
he died; and there was great mourning in Chaldea, 
and also in the court of Pharaoh; which Pharaoh 
signifies king by royal blood.

21. Now this king of Egypt was a descendant 
from the loins of Ham,* and was a partaker of the 
blood of the Canaanites by birth. 

22. From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, 
and thus the blood of the Canaanites was preserved 
in the land. 

23. The land of Egypt being first discovered by 
a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the 
daughter of Egyptus, which in the Chaldean sig- 
nifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbid- 
den. 

24. When this woman discovered the land it was 
under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; 
and thus, from Ham,^ sprang that race which pre- 
served the curse in the land.*" 

25. Now the firat government of Egypt was es- 
tablished by Pharaoh,** the eldest son of Egyptus, 
the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner 
of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal.® 

26. Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established 
his kingdom and judged his people wisely and 
justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that 
order established by the fathers in the first genera- 
tions, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even 
in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, 
who blessed him with the blessings of the earth, and 
with the blessings of wisdom, but cursed him as per- 
taining to the Priesthood. 

27. Now, PharaohP being of that lineage by 
which he could not have the right of Priesthood, 
notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it 
from Noah, through Ham,« therefore my father was 
led away by their idolatry;**

come into my hands, which I hold unto this present

29. Now, after the priest of Elkenah was smit- 
ten that he died,* there came a fulfilment of those 
things which were said unto me concerning the 
land of Chaldea," that there should be a famine in 
the land.*^ 

30. Accordingly a famine prevailed throughout 
all the land of Chaldea, and my father was sorely 
tormented because of the famine, and he repented 
of the evil which he had determined against me, to 
take away my life.*^ 

31. But the records of the fathers,^ even the pa- 
triarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood,*' the 
Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; there- 
fore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, 
and also of the planets, and of the stars,^ as they 
were made known unto the fathers, have I kept 
even unto this day; and I shall endeavor to write 
some of these things upon this record, for the bene- 
fit of my posterity that shall come after me.

3. Xow, the Lord had said unto me: Abraham, 
get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, 
and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will 
show thee 

4. Therefore I left the land of Ur, of the Chal- 
dees,^ to go into the land of Canaan/ and I took 
Lot, my brother's son, and his wife, and Sarai, my 
wife; and also my fathers' followed after me, unto 
the land which we denominated Haran.^ 

5. And the famine abated; and my father tar- 
ried in Haran and dwelt there, as there were many 
flocks in Haran; and my father turned again unto 
his idolatry,^ therefore he continued in Haran. 

6. But I, Abraham, and Lot, my brother's son, 
prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord appeared unto 
me, and said unto me:^ Arise, and take Lot with 
thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out of 
Haran,* and to make of thee a minister to bear my 
name in a strange land which I will give unto thy 
seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when 
they hearken to my voice. 

7. For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in

the wind and the fire to be my chariot ; I say to the 
mountains — Depart hence — and behold, they are

forth in the way to the land of Canaan,^ and dwelt

our rock and our salvation, as we journeyed from 
Haran by the way of Jershon, to come to the land 
of Canaan.^ 

17. Now I, Abraham, built an altar in the land 
of Jershon, and made an offering unto the Lord, 
and prayed that the famine^ might be turned away 
from my father^s house, that they might not perish. 

18. And then we passed from Jershon through

in the plains of Moreh, and we had already come 
into the borders of the land of the Canaanites,^ and 
I offered sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh, and

5. And the Lord said unto me : The planet which 
is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule 
the day, even the night, is above or greater than 
that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning, 
for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order 
because it standeth above the earth upon which thou 
standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not 
so many as to its number of days, and of months, 
and of years. 

6. And the Lord said unto- me : Now, Abraham, 
these two facts exist,^ behold thine eyes see it; it 
is given unto thee to know the times of reckoning, 
and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth 
upon which thou standest, and the set time of the 
greater light which is set to rule the day, and the 
set time of the lesser light which is set to rule the 
night.* 

7. Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer 
time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the 
time of the earth upon which thou standest. 

8. And where these two facts exist,^ there shall 
be another fact above them, that is, there shall be

EXPLANATION OF THE FOREGOING CUT. 

Fti;. 1. Kolob. signifying the first creation, nearest to the oele^tol, 
or resulenoe of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the 
measurement of time. The measurement according tu celestial time 
which celtotial (^ime signifies one day to a cubit. One day in Kolob is 
equal to ^ thousand years, according to the measurement of this earth, 
i^nich is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh. 

Fig. 2. Stands next to Kolob, called by the Egyptians Oliblish, which 
IS the next granJ governing creation near to the celestial or the place 
where God resides; holding the key of power also, pertaininf; to other 
planets; as revealed from God to Abraham, as he onere&lt;i sacrifice upon 
an altar, which he had built unto the Lord. 

Fig. 3. Is made to represent God, sitting upon his throne, clothed 
with pojver and authority; with a crown of eternal light upon nis head; 
representing also the grand Key-Words of the Holy Priesthood, as re- 
vealed to Adam in the Garden of Eden, as also to Seth, Noah, Melchise- 
f}eck, Abraham, and all to whom the Priesthood was revealed. 

Fig. 4. Answers to the Hebrew word Raukeeyang, signifying ex- 
(mnse, or the firmament of the heavens; also a numerical figure, in Egyih- 
tian signifyinc; one thousand: answering to the measuring of the time 
of Oliblish, which is equal with Kolob in its revolution and m its measur- 
ing of time. 

Fig. 5.. Is called in Egyptian Enish-go-on-dosh; this is one of the 
governing planets also, and is said by the Egyptians to be the Sun, and 
to borrow its light from Kolob through the medium of Kae-e-vanrash, 
which is the granrl Key,, or, in other words, the governing power, which 
governs fifteen other fixed planets or stars, as also Floeese or the Moon, 
the Earth and the Sun in their annual revolutions. This planet receives 
its power through the medium of Kli-flos-is-es, or Hah-ko-kau-beam, the 
ritars represented by numbers 22 and 23. receiving light from the revo- 
lutions of Kolob. 

Fig. 6. Represents the earth in its four quarters. 

Fig. 7. Represents God sitting upon his throne revealing through 
the heavens, the grand Key-Words of the Priesthood; as also, the sign 
of the Holy Ghost unto Abraham, in the form of a dove.

another planet whose reckoning of time shall be 
longer still; 

9. And thus there shall be the reckoning of the 
time of one planet above another, until thou come 
nigh unto' Kolob,*" which Kolob is after the reckon- 
ing of the Lord^s time ;** which Kolob is set nigh unto 
the throne of God, to govern all those planets which 
belong to the same order as that upon which thou 
standest. 

10. And it is given unto thee to know the set 
time of all the stars that are set to give light, until 
thou come near unto the throne of God.® 

11. Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord,** face 
to f ace,^ as one man talketh with another ; and he told 
me of the works which his hands had made;*" 

12. And he said unto me: My son, my son, (and 
his hand was stretched out,) behold I will show you 
all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and 
I saw those things which his hands had made, which 
were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, 
and I could not see the end thereof.* 

13. And he said unto me: This is Shinehah, 
which is the sun. And he said unto me: Kokob, 
which is star. And he said unto me: Olea, which 
is the moon. And he said imto me: Kokaubeam,* 
which signifies stars, or all. the great lights, which 
were in the firmament of heaven. 

14. And it was in the night time when the Lord 
spake these words unto me: I will multiply thee, 
and thy seed after thee,^ like unto these ; and if thou 
canst count the number of sands, so shall be the 
number of thy seeds. 

15. And the Lord said unto me: Abraham, I 
show these things unto thee before ye go into 'Egypt, 
that ye may declare all these words.

16. If two things exist,*' and there be one above 
the other, there shall be greater things above them '^ 
therefore Kolob^ is the greatest of all the Kokau- 
beamJ' that thou hast seen, because it is nearest 
unto me. 

17. Now, if there be two things, one above the 
other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may 
be that a planet or a star may exist above it; and 
there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in 
his heart to do but what he will do it. 

18. Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, 
also, if there be two spirits, and one shall be m^ore 
intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, not- 
withstanding one is more intelligent than the other, 
have no beginning; they existed before, they shall 
have no end, they shall exist after, for they are 
gnolaum, or eternal.^ 

19. And the Lord said unto me : These two facts 
do exist,** that there are two spirits, one being more 
intelligent than the other; there shall be another 
more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, 
I am more intelligent than they all. 

20. The Lord thy God sent his angel to deliver 
thee from the hands of the priest of Elkenah.* 

21. I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, 
therefore, have come down unto thee to deliver unto 
thee the works which my hands have made,^ wherein 
my wisdom excelleth them all, for I rule in the 
heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wis- 
dom and prudence, over all the intelligences^ thine 
eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in 
the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences 
thou hast seen.

the intelligences^ that were organized before the world 
was; and among all these there were many of the 
noble and great ones ; 

23. And God saw these souls that they were good, 
and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: 
These I will make my rulers; for he stood among 
those that were spirits/ and he saw that they were 
good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one 
of them ; thou wast ehosenfl' before thou wast born. 

24. And there stood one among them that was 
like unto God,* and he said unto those who were 
with him : We will go down, for there is space there, 
and we will take of these materials, and we will 
make an earth whereon these may dwell ; 

25. And we will prove them herewith, to see if 
they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their 
God shall command them; 

26. And they who keep their first estate shall be 
added upon; and they who keep not their first estate 
shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those 
who keep their first estate ;* and they who keep their 
second estate shall have glory added upon their heads 
forever and ever. 

27. And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? 
And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here 
am I, send me. And another answered and said: 
Here am I, send me.^* And the Lord said: I will 
send the first. 

28. And the second was angry,* and kept not 
his, first estate;* and, at that day, many followed 
after him.

1. And then the Lord said: Let ns go down. 
And they went down at the beginning, and they, 
that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens 
and the earth. 

*4. And the earth, after it was formed, was empty 
and desolate, because they had not formed anything 
but the earth; and darkness reigned upon the face 
of the deep, and the Spirit of the Gods was brooding 
upon the face of the waters. 

3. And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; 
and there was light. 

4. And they (the Gods) comprehended the light, 
for it was bright; and they divided the light, or 
caused it to be divided, from the darkness. 

5. And the Gods called the light Day, and the 
darkness they called Night. And it came to pass 
that from the evening until morning they called 
night; and from the morning until the evening they 
called day; and this was the first, or the beginning, 
of that which they called day and night. ^ 

6. And the Gods also said: Let there be an 
expanse in the midst of the waters, and it shall 
divide the waters from the waters. 

7. And the Gods ordered the expanse, so that it 
divided the waters which were under the expanse 
from the waters which were above the expanse; and 
it was so, even as they ordered.^ 

8. And the Gods called the expanse. Heaven. 
And it came to pass that it was from evening until 
morning that they called night; and it came to pass 
that it was from morning until evening that they

called night and day.^ 

9. And the Gods ordered, saying: Let the waters 
under the heaven be gathered together unto one 
place, and let the earth come up dry; and it was so 
as they ordered; 

10. And the Gods pronounced the dry land, earth ; 
and the gathering together of the waters, pronounced 
they, great waters; and the Gods saw that they were 
obeyed.*' 

11. And the Gods said: Let us prepare the earth 
to bring forth grass; the herb yielding seed; the 
fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind, whose seed 
in itself yieldeth its own likeness upon the earth ; and 
it was so, even as they ordered.^ 

'12. And the Gods organized the earth to bring 
forth grass from its own seed, and the herb to bring 
forth herb from its own seed, yielding seed after his 
kind; and the earth to bring forth the tree from its 
own seed, yielding fruit, whose seed could only bring 
forth the same in itself, after his kind; and the Gods 
saw that they were obeyed.*' 

13. And it came to pass that they numbered the 
days ; from the evening until the morning they called 
night; and it came to pass, from the morning until 
the evening they called day; and it was the third 
time.'^ 

14. And the Gods organized the lights in the 
expanse of the heaven, and caused them to divide 
the day from the night; and organized them to be 
for signs and for seasons, and for days and for 
years ;

16. And the Gods organized the two great lights,, 
the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light 
to rule the night ; with the lesser light they set the 
stars also ; ^ 

17. And the Gods set them in the expanse of the 
heavens, to give light upon the earth, and to rule 
over the day and over' the night, and to cause to 
divide the light from the darkness. 

18. And the Gods watched those things which 
they had ordered until they obeyed. 

19. And it came to pass that it was from evening 
until morning that it was night ; and it came to pass 
that it was from morning until evening that it was 
day; and it was the fourth time.* 

20. And the Gods said : Let us prepare the waters 
to bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that 
have life; and the fowl, that they may fly above the 
earth in the open expanse of heaven. 

21. And the Gods prepared the waters that they 
might bring forth great whales, and every living 
creature that moveth, which the waters were to 
bring forth abundantly after their kind; and every 
winged fowl after their kind. And the Gods saw 
that they would be obeyed,^ and that their plan was 
good. 

22. And the Gods said : We will bless them, and 
cause them to be fruitful and multiply, and fill the 
waters in the seas or great waters; and cause the 
fowl to multiply in the earth. 

23. And it came to pass that it was from evening 
until morning that they called night; and it came to 
pass that it was from morning until evening that 
they called day ; and it was the fifth time.*

forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and

creeping things, and the beasts of the earth after their 
kind; and it was so, as they had said.^ 

25. And the God^ organized the earth to bring 
forth the beasts after their kind, and cattle after 
their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the 
earth after its kind; and the Gods saw they would 
obey.*^ 

26. And the Gods took counsel among themselves 
and said: Let us go down and form man in our 
image, after our likeness; and we will give them 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl 
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, 
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
earth. 

27. So the Gods went down to organize man in 
their own image, in the image of the Gods to form 
they him, male and female to form they them. 

28. And the Gods said : We will bless them* And 
the Gods said : We will cause them to be fruitful, and 
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, 
and to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and 
over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing 
that moveth upon the earth. 

29. And the Gods said: Behold, we will give 
them every herb bearing seed that shall come upon 
the face of all the earth, and every tree which shall 
have fruit upon it; yea the fruit of the tree yielding 
seed, to them we will give it; it shall be for their 
meat. 

30. And to every beast of the earth, and to every 
fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon 
the earth, behold, we will give them life, and also we 
will give to them every green herb for meat; and all 
these things shall be thus organized.

1.* And thus we will finish the heavens and the

2. And the Gods said among themselves : On the 
seventh time^ we will end our work, which we have 
counseled ; and we will rest on the seventh time from 
all our work which we have counseled. 

3. And the Gods concluded upon the seventh 
time,*' because that on the seventh time they would 
rest from all their works which they (the Gods) coun- 
seled among themselves to form ; and sanctified it. 
And thus were their decisions at the time that they 
counseled among themselves to form the heavens and 
the earth. 

4. And the Gods came down and formed these

they were formed in the day that the Gods formed

cerning every plant of the field before it was in the

6. But there went up a mist from the earth, and

7. And the Gods formed man from the dust of 
the ground, and took his spirit, (that is, the man's 
spirit,) and put it into him; and breathed into his 
nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living 
soul. 

8. And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in 
Eden, and there they put the man, whose spirit they 
had put into the body which they had formed. 

9. And out of the ground made the Gods to 
grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and 
good for food; the tree of life, also, in the midst of 
the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and 
evil. 

10. There was a river running out of Eden, to 
water the garden, and from thence it was parted and 
became into four heads.** 

11.^ And the Gods took the man and put him in 
the Garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. 

12. And the Gods commanded the man, saying: 
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, 

13. But of the tree of knowledge of good and 
evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that 
thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now I, 
Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord's time,^ 
which was after the time of Kolob;*' for as yet the 
Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning. 

14. And the Gods said: Let us make an help- 
meet for the man, for it is not good that the man 
should be alone, therefore we will form an help-meet 
for him.'^

17. And Adam said : This was bone of my bones, 
and flesh of my flesh ; now she shall- be called Woman, 
because she was taken out of man ; 

18. Therefore shall a man leave his father and

WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 



An Extract from a Translation of the 
Bible. 

Being the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, 
commencing with the last verse of the twenty* 
third chapter. King James' Translation. 



1. For I say unto you, that ye shall not see me 
henceforth and know that I am he of whom it is 
written by the prophets, until ye shall say : Blessed 
is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, in the 
clouds of heaven, and all the holy angels with him. 
Then understood his disciples that he should come 
again on the earth, after that he was glorified and 
crowned on the right hand of God. 

2. And Jesus went out, and departed from the 
temple; and his disciples came to him, for to hear 
him, saying : Master, show us concerning the buildings 
of the temple, as thou hast said — They shall be thrown 
down, and left unto you desolate. 

3. And Jesus said unto them: See ye not all

these things, and do ye not understand them ? Verily 
I say unto you, there shall not be left here, upon this 
temple, one stone upon another that shall not be 
thrown down. 

4. And Jesus left them, and went upon the Mount 
of Olives. And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, 
the disciples came unto him privately, saying: Tell 
us when shall these things be which thou hast said 
concerning the destruction of the temple, and the 
Jews ; and what is the sign of thy coming, and of the 
end of the world, or the destruction of the wicked, 
which is the end of the world ? 

5. And Jesus answered, and said unto them : Take 
heed that no man deceive you ; 

6. For many shall come in my name, saying — I 
am Christ — and shall deceive many; 

7. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, 
and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations, 
for my name's sake; 

8. And then shall many be offended, and shall 
betray one another ; 

9. And many false prophets shall arise, and shall 
deceive many; 

10. And because iniquity shall abound, the love 
of many shall wax cold; 

11. But he that remaineth steadfast and is not 
overcome, the same shall be saved. 

12. When you, therefore, shall see the abomina- 
tion of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, 
concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, then you 
shall stand in the holy place; whoso readeth let him 
understand. 

13. Then let them who are in Judea flee into the 
mountains ; 

14. Let him who is on the housetop flee, and not 
return to take anything out of his house; 

15. Neither let him who is in the field return 
back to take his clothes;

unto them that give suck in those days ; 

17. Therefore, pray ye the Lord that your flight 
be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day ; 

18. For then, in those days, shall be great tribu- 
lations on the Jews, and upon the inhabitants* of 
Jerusalem, such as was not before sent upon Israel, 
of God, since the. beginning of their kingdom until 
this time; no, nor ever shall be sent again upon

19. All things which have befallen them, are 
only the beginning of the sorrows which shall come 
upon them. 

20. And except those days should be shortened, 
there should none of their flesh be saved; but for 
the elect's sake, according to the covenant, those days 
shall be shortened.

concerning the Jews ; and again, after the tribulation 
of those days which shall come upon Jerusalem, if 
any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or 
there, believe him not; 

22. For in those days there shall also arise false 
Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great 
signs and wonders, insomuch, that, if possible, they 
shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect accord- 
ing to the covenant.

elect's sake; and you also shall hear of wars, and 
rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled, for all 
I have told you must come to pass; but the end is

24. Behold, I have told you before. 

25. Wherefore, if they shall say unto you: Behold, 
he is in the desert ; go not forth ; Behold, he is in the 
secret chambers; believe it not; 

26. For as the light of the morning cometh out

of the east, and sliineth even unto the west, and 
covereth the whole earth, so shall also the coming of 
the Son of Man be. 

27. And now I show unto you a parable. Be- 
hold, wheresoever the carcass is, there will the 
eagles be gathered together; so likewise shall mine 
elect be gathered from the four quarters of the 
earth. 

28. And they shall hear of wars, and rumors of 
wars. 

29. Behold I speak for mine elect's sake; for 
nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against 
kingdom; there shall be famines, and pestilences, 
and earthquakes, in divers places. 

30. And again, because iniquity shall abound, the 
love of many shall wax cold ; but he that shall not be 
overcome, the same shall be saved. 

31. And again, this Gospel of the Kingdom shall 
be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all 
nations, and then shall the end come, or the destruc- 
tion of the wicked; 

32. And again shall the abomination of desola- 
tion, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, be fulfilled. 

33. And immediately after the tribulation of 
those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon 
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall 
from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be 
shaken. 

34. Verily, I say unto you, this generation, in 
which these things shall be shown forth, shall not 
pass away until all I have told you shall be fulfilled. 

35. Although, the days will come, that heaven 
and earth shall pass away; yet my words shall not 
pass away, but all shall be fulfilled. 

36. And, as I said before, after the tribulation 
of those days, and the powers of the heavens shall 
be shaken; then shall appear the sign of the Son of 
Man in heaven^ and then shall all the tribes of the 







I.] WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. '&lt; 9 

earth mourn; and they shall see the Son of Man 
coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and 
great glory; 

37. And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not 
be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he 
shall send his angels before him with the great sound 
of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the 
remainder of his elect from the four winds, from one 
end of heaven to the other. 

38. Now learn a parable of the fig tree : — when its 
branches are yet tender, and it begins to put forth 
leaves, you know that summer is nigh at hand; 

39. So likewise, mine elect, when they shall see 
all these things, they shall know that he is near, even 
at the doors; 

40. But of that day, and hour, no one knoweth; 
no, not the angels of God in heaven, but my Father 
only. 

41. But as it was in the days of Noah, so it shall 
be also at the coming of the Son of Man ; 

42. For it shall be with them, as it was in the 
days which were before the flood; for until the day 
that Noah entered into the ark they were eating and 
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; 

43. And knew not until the flood came, and took 
them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son 
of Man be. 

44. Then shall be fulfilled that which is written, 
that in the last days, two shall be in the field, the one 
shall be taken, and the other left ; 

45. Two shall be grinding at the mill, the one 
shall be taken, and the other left ; 

46. And what I say unto one, I say unto all men ; 
watch, therefore, for you know not at what hour your 
Lord doth come. 

47. But know this, if the good man of the house 
had known in what watch the thief would come, he 
would have watched, and would not have sufferc'

his house to have been broken up, but would have 
been ready. 

48. Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an 
hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh. 

49. Who, then, is a faithful and wise servant^ 
whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, 
to give them meat in due season? 

50. Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when 
he cometh, shall find so doing; and verily I say 
unto you, he shall make him ruler over all his goods. 

51. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart : 
My lord delayeth his coming, 

52. And shall begin to smite his fellow^servants, 
and to eat and drink with the drunken, 

53. The lord of that servant shall come in a day 
when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he 
is not aware of, 

54. And shall cut him asunder, and shall appoint 
him his portion with the hynocrites; there shall be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

55. And thus cometh the end of the wicked, 
according to the prophecy of Moses, saying: They 
shall be cut off from among the people; but the end 
of the earth is not yet, but by and by.

Extracts from the History of Joseph Smith. 



1. Owing to the many reports which have been 
put in circulation by evil-disposed and designing per- 
sons, in relation to the rise and progress of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have 
been designed by the authors thereof *to militate 
against its character as a Church and its progress in 
the world — I have been induced to write this his- 
tory, to disabuse the public mind, and put all 
inquirers after truth in possession of the facts, as 
they have transpired, in relation both to myself and 
to the Church, so far as I have such facts in my 
possession. 

2. In this history I shall present the various events 
in relation to this Church, in truth and righteous- 
ness, as they have transpired, or as they at present 
exist, being now the eighth year since the organiza- 
tion of the said Church. 

3. I was bom in the year of our Lord one thou- 
sand eight hundred and^ five, on the twenty-third day 
of December, in the town of Sharon, Windsor county, 
State of Vermont. My father, Joseph Smith, Senior, 
left the State of Vermont, and moved to Palmyra, 
Ontario (now Wayne) county, in the State of New 
York, when I was in my tenth year, or thereabouts. 
In about four years after my father's arrival in Pal- 
myra, he moved with his family into Manchester, in 
the same county of Ontario. 

4. His family consisted of eleven souls, namely 
— my father, Joseph Smith; my mother, Lucy Smith 







82 PEARL OP GREAT PRICE. 

(whose name, previous to her marriage, was Mack, 
daughter of Solomon Mack) ; my brothers, AlVin, 
(who died November 19th, 1824, in the 27th year of 
his age), Hyrum, myself, Samuel Harrison, William, 
Don Carlos ; and my sisters, Sophronia, Catherine, 
and Lucy. 

5. Some time in the second year after our removal 
to Manchester, there was in the place where we 
lived an unusual excitement on the subject of 
religion. It commenced with the Methodists, but 
soon became general among all the sects in that 
region of country. Indeed, the whole district of 
country seemed affected by it, and great multitudes 
united themselves to the different religious parties, 
which created no small stir and division amongst 
the people, some crying, "Lo, here!^^ and others, 
^Tjo, there !'^ Some were contending for the Meth- 
odist faith, some for the Presbyterian, and some for 
the Baptist. 

6. For notwithstanding the great love which the 
converts to these different faiths expressed at the 
time of their conversion, and the great zeal mani- 
fested by the respective clergy, who were active in 
getting up and promoting this extraordinary scene 
of religious feeling, in order to have everybody con- 
verted, as they were pleased to call it, let them 
join what sect they pleased — ^yet when the converts 
beg^K k) file off, some to one party and some to 
another, it was seen that the seemingly good feelings 
of both the priests and the converts were more 
pretended than real; for a scene of great confusion 
and bad feeling ensued; priest contending against 
priest, and convert against convert; so that all their 
good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, 
were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest 
about opinions. 

7. I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My 
father's family was proselyted to the Presbyterian 







II.] WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 83 

faith, and four of them joined that church, namely 
— my mother Lucy ; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel 
Harrison; and my sister Sophronia. 

8. During this time of great excitement, my 
mind was called up to serious reflection and great 
uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and 
often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all 
these parties, though I attended their several meet- 
ings as often as occasion would permit. In process 
of time my mind became somewhat partial to the 
Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united 
with them; but so great were the confusion and 
strife among the different denominations, that it 
was impossible for a person young as I was, and so 
imacquainted with men and things, to come to any 
certain conclusion who was right and who was 
wrong. 

9. My mind at times was greatly excited, the 
cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The 
Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists 
and Methodists, and used all the powers of either 
reason or sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, 
to make the people think they were in error. On the 
other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their 
turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish 
their o\gi tenets and disprove all others. 

10. In the midst of this war of words and tumult 
of opinions, I often said to myself. What is to be done ? 
Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all 
wrong together ? If any one of them be right, which 
is it, and how shall I know it? 

11. While I was laboring under the extreme diffi- 
culties caused by the contests of these parties of 
religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of 
James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: 
// any of you lack wisdom, let him ash of God, that 
giveth to all men liberally, and uphraideth not; and 
it shall ie given him. 







84 PEARL OF GREAT PRICE. 

12. Never did any passage of scripture come with 
more power to the heart of man than this did 
at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great 
force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on 
it again and again, knowing that if any person needed 
wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did 
not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than 
I then had, I would never know; for the teachers 
of religion of the different sects understood the same 
passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all 
confidence in settling the question by an appeal to 
the Bible. 

13. At length I came to the conclusion that I 
must either remain in darkness and confusion, or 
else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. 
I at length came to the determination to "ask of 
God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them 
that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and 
not upbraid, I might venture. 

14. So, in accordance with this, my determina- 
tion to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make 
the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, 
clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred 
and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I 
had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anx- 
ieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray 
vocally. 

15. After I had retired to the place where I had 
previously designed to go, having looked around 
me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and 
began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. 
I had scarcely done so, when immediately I .war 
seized upon by some power whioh entirely overcame 
me, and had such an astonishing influence over me 
as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. 
Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed 
to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden 
destruction. 







II.] WRITIXGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 85 

16. But, exerting all my powers to call upon God 
to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which 
had seized upon me, and at the very moment when 
I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself 
to destruction — not to an imaginary ruin, but to 
the power of some actual being from the unseen 
world, who had such marvelous power as I had never 
before felt in any being — ^just at this moment of great 
alarm, I saw a pillar of liffht exactly over my head, 
above the brightness of the sun, which -descended 
gradually until it fell upon me. 

17. It no sooner appeared than I found myself 
delivered from the enemy which held me bound. 
When the light rested upon me I saw two person- 
ages, whose brightness and glory defy all descrip- 
tion, standing above me in the air. One of them 
spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, 
pointing to the other — This is my beloved Son, hear 
him ! 

18. My object in going to inquire of the Lord 
was to know which of all the sects was right, that I 
might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, 
did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to 
speak, than I asked the personages who stood above 
me in the light, which of all the sects was right — 
and which I should join. 

19. I was answered that I must join none of 
them, for they were all wrong; and the personage 
who addressed me said that all their creeds were an 
abomination in his sight; that those professors were 
all corrupt; that "they draw near to me with their 
lips, but their hearts are far from me; they teach 
for doctrines the commandments of men, hav- 
ing a form of godliness, but they deny the power 
thereof.^' 

20. He again forbade me to join with any of them ; 
and many other things did he say unto me, which 
I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself

86 PEARL OF GREAT PRICE. 

again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up 
into heaven. 

21. Some few days after I had this vision, I hap- 
pened to be in company with one of the Methodist 
preachers, who was very active in the before men- 
tioned religious excitement; and, conversing with 
him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to 
give him an account of the vision which I had had. 
I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated 
my communication not only lightly, but with great 
contempt, saying, it was all of the devil, that there 
were no such things as visions or revelations in these 
days; that all such things had ceased with the apos- 
tles, and that there would never be any more of 
them. 

22. I soon found, however, that my telling the 
story had excited a great deal of prejudice against 
me among professors of religion, and was the cause 
of great persecution, which continued to increase; 
and though I was an obscure boy, only between 
fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circum- 
stances in life such as to make a boy of no conse- 
quence in the world, yet men of high standing would 
take notice sufficient to excite the public mind 
against me, and create a bitter persecution; and 
this was common among all the sects — ^all united to 
persecute me. 

23. It caused me serious reflection then, and often 
has since, how very strange it was that an obscure 
boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, 
too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a 
scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be 
thought a character of sufficient importance to attract 
the attention of the great ones of the most popular 
sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them 
a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. 
But strange or not, so it was, and it was often th&lt;! 
cause of great sorrow to myself. 







II,.] AVUlTlN'GS OP JOSKlni SMITH. 8? 

24. However, it was nevertheless a fact that I 
had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt 
much like Paul,* when he made his defense before 
King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision 
he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but 
still there were but few who believed him; some 
said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and 
he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not 
destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a 
vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under 
lieaven could not make it otherwise; and though 
they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, 
and would know to his latest breath, that he had 
both seen a light, and heard a voice speaking unto 
him, and all the world could not make him think or 
believe otherwise. 

25. So it was with me. I had actually seen a 
light, and in the midst of that light I saw two per- 
sonages, and they did in reality speak to me; and 
though I was hated and persecuted for saying that 
I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they 
were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking 
all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, 
I was led to say in my heart : Why persecute me for 
telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision, 
and who am I that I can withstand God, or why 
does the world think to make me deny what I have 
actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, 
and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny 
it, neither dared I do it, at least I knew that 
by so doing I would offend God, and come under 
condemnation. 

26. I had now got my mind satisfied so far as 
the sectarian world was concerned; that it was not 
my duty to join with any of them, but to continue 
as I was until further directed. I had found the 

a, See Acts, ehapter 26.

88 PEARL OF GREAT PRICE. 

testimony of James to be true, that a man who lacked 
wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be 
upbraided. 

27. I continued to pursue my common vocations 
in life until the twenty-first of September, one thou- 
sand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time 
suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes 
of men, both religious and irreligious, because I con- 
tinued to affirm that I had seen a vision. 

28. During the space of time which intervened 
between the time I had the vision and the year 
eighteen hundred and twenty-three — ^having been 
forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the 
day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted 
by those who ought to have been my friends and to 
have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to 
be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affec- 
tionate manner to have reclaimed me, — I was left 
to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all 
kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish 
errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the 
foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, 
led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight 
of God. 

29. In consequence of these things, I often felt 
condenmed for my weakness and imperfections ; when, 
on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first 
of September, after I had retired to my bed for the 
night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to 
Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and 
follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I 
might know of my state and standing before him; 
for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine mani- 
festation, as I previously had one. 

30. While I was thus in the act of calling upon 
God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, 
which continued to increase until the room was lighter 
than at noonday, when immediately a personage 







II.] WRITINGS OP JOSEPH SMITH. 89 

appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his 
feet did not touch the floor. 

31. He had on a loose robe of most exquisite 
whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything 
earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any 
earthly thing could be made to appear so exceed- 
ingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, 
and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, 
were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above 
the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I 
could discover that he had no other clothing on but 
this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his 
bosom. 

32. Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but 
his whole person was glorious beyond description, 
and his countenance truly like lightning. The 
room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright 
as immediately around his person. When I first 
looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon 
left me. 

33. He called me by name, and said unto me that 
he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to 
me, and that his name was Moroni ; that God had a 
work for me to do; and that my name should be 
had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, 
and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil 
spoken of among all people. 

34. He said there was a book deposited, written 
upon gold plates, giving an account of the former 
inhabitants of this continent, and the source from 
whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness 
of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as 
delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants ; 

35. Also, that there were two stones in silver 
bows — and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, 
constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim 
— deposited with the plates ; and the possession and 
use of these stones were what constituted ^^seers" in 







C'v) PEAUL OP GlllCAT I^UICE. 

ancient or former times ; and that God had prepared 
them for the purpose of translating the book. 

36. After telling me these things, he commenced 
quoting the propheeies of the Old Testament.' He 
first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi, 
and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the 
same prophecy, though with a little variation from 
the way it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting 
the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted 
ii thus : 

37. For behold, the day cometh that shall burn 
as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do 
wickedly, shall burn as stubble; for they that come 
shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that ii 
shall leave them neither root nor branch, 

38. And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus: 
Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the 
hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord. 

39. He also quoted the next verse differently: 
And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the 
promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the 
children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so, 
the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his 
coming. 

40. In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh 
chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be 
fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, 
twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as 
they stand in our New Testament. He said that 
that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet 
come when they who would not hear his voieo 
should be cut off from among the people, but soon 
would come. I 

41. He also quoted the second chapter of Joel J 
from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also' 
said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon ta 
be. And he further stated that the fulness of the 







II.] WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 91 

Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many 
other passages of scripture, and offered many expla- 
nations which cannot be mentioned here. 

42. Again, he told me, that when I got those 
plated of which he had spoken — for the time that 
they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled — I 
should not show them to any person; neither the 
breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to 
those to whom I should be commanded to show 
them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he 
was conversing with me about the plates, the vision 
was opened to my mind that I could see the place 
where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly 
and distinctly that I knew the place again when I 
visited it. 

43. After this communication, I saw the light 
in the room begin to gather immediately around 
the person of him who had been speaking to me, and 
it continued to do so, tintil the room was again left 
dark, except just around him, when instantly I saw, 
as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and 
he ascended till he ^itirely disappeared, and the 
room was left as it had been before this heavenly 
light ^lad made its appearance. 

44. I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, 
and marveling greatly at what had been told to me 
by this extraordinary messenger ; when, in the midst 
of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room 
was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, 
as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again 
by my bedside. 

45. He commenced, and again related the very 
same things which he had done at his first visit, 
without the least variation; which having done, he 
informed me of great judgments which were coming 
upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, 
sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judg- 
ments would come on the earth in this generation.

Having related these things, he again ascended as he 
had done before. 

46. By this time, so deep were the impressions 
made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, 
and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at what I 
had both seen and heard. But what was my sur- 
prise when again I beheld the same messenger at my 
bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again 
to me the same things as before; and added a cau- 
tion to me, telling me that Satan would try to 
tempt me, (in consequence of the indigent circum- 
stances of my father^s family), to get the plates for 
the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, 
saying that I must have uq other object in view in 
getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not 
be influenced by any other motive than that of 
building his kingdom; otherwise I could not get 
them. 

47. After this third visit, he again ascended into 
heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder 
on the strangeness of what I had just experienced; 

"when almost immediately after the heavenly mes-^ 
senger had ascended from me for the third time, the 
cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, 
so that our interviews must have occupied* the whole 
of that night. 

48. I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as 
usual, went to the necessary labors of the day; but, 
in attempting to work as at other times, I found my 
strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. 
My father, who was laboring along with me, discov- 
ered something to be wrong with me, and told me to 
go home. I started with the intention of going to 
the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out 
of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed 
me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a time 
was quite unconscious of anything. 

49. The first thing that I can recollect was a

voice speaking unto me, calling me by name. J 
looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing 
over my head, surrounded by light as before. He 
the© again related unto me all that he had related 
to me the previous night, and commanded me to go 
to my father and tell him of the vision and com- 
mandments which I had received. 

50. I obeyed; I returned * to my father in the 
field, and rehearsed the whole matter to him. He 
replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go 
and do as commanded by the messenger. I left the 
field, and went to the place where the messenger 
had told me the plates were deposited; and owing 
to the distinctness of the vision which I had had 
concerning it, I knew the place the instant that I 
arrived there. 

51. Convenient to the village of Manchester, 
Ontario county. New York, stands a hill of consid- 
erable size, and the most elevated of any in the 
neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not 
far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, 
lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone 
was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper 
side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the mid- 
dle part of it was visible above the ground, but the 
edge all around was covered with earth. 

52. Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, 
which I got fixed under the edge of the stone, and 
with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and 
there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and 
Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the mes- 
senger. The box in which they lay was formed by 
laying stones together in some kind of cement In 
the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways 
of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the 
other things with them. 

53. I made an attempt to take them out, but 
was forbidden by the messenger, and was again

informed that the time for bringing them forth had 
not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years 
from that time; but he told me that I should come 
to that place precisely in one year from that time, and 
that he would there meet with me, and that I should 
continue to do so until the time should come for 
obtaining the plates. 

54. Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I 
went at the end of each year, and at each time' I 
found the same messenger there, and received instruc- 
tion and intelligence from him at each of our inter- 
views, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and 
how and in what manner his kingdom was to be 
conducted in the last days. 

55. As my father's worldly circumstances were 
very limited, we were under the necessity of laboring 
with our hands, hiring out by da/s work and other- 
wise, as 'we could get opportunity. Sometimes we 
were at home, and sometimes abroad, and by con- 
tinuous labor, were enabled to get a comfortable 
maintenance. 

56. In the year 1824 my father's family met 
with a great affliction by the death of my eldest 
brother, Alvin. In the month of October, 1825, I 
hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah 
Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, state of New 
York. He had heard something of a silver mine 
having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony, 
Susquehanna county, state of Pennsylvania; and 
had, previous to my hiring to him, been digging, in 
order, if possible, to discover the mine. After I 
went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of 
his hands, to dig for the silver mine, at which I 
continued to work for nearly a month, without suc- 
cess in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with 
the old gentleman to cease digging after it. Hence 
arose the very prevalent story of my having been a 
money-digger.

57. During the time that I was thus employed, 
I was -put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale, of that 
place; it was there I first saw my wife (his daugh- 
ter), Emma Hale. On the 18th of January, 1827, 
we were married, while I was yet employed in the 
service of Mr. Stoal. 

58. Owing to my continuing to assert that I 
had seen a vision, persecution still followed me, and 
my wife's father's family "were very much opposed 
to our being married. I was, therefore, under the 
necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and 
were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in 
South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York. 
Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. StoaFs, 
and went to my father's, and farmed with him that 
season. 

59. At length the time arrived for obtaining the 
plates, the TJrim and Thummim, and the breast- 
plate. On the twenty-second day of September, one 
thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having 
gone as usual at the end of another year to the 
place where they were deposited, the same heavenly 
messenger delivered them up to me with this charge : 
that I should be responsible for them; that if 
I should let them go carelessly, or through any 
neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I 
would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until 
he, the messenger, should call for them, they should 
be protected. 

60. I soon found out the reason why I had 
received such strict charges to keep them safe, and 
why it was that the messenger had said that when I 
had done what was required at my hand, he would 
call for them. For no sooner was it known that I 
had them, than the most strenuous exertions were 
used to get them from me. Every stratagem that 
could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. 
The persecution became more bitter and severe than 







96 PEARL OF GEEAT PRICE. 

before, and multitudes were on the alert continually 
to get them from me if possible. But by the Wisdom 
of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had 
accomplished by them what was required at my hand. 
When, according to arrangements, the 'messenger 
called for them, I delivered them up to him; and 
he has them in his charge until this day, being the 
second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and 
thirty-eight. 

61. The excitement, however, still continued, and 
rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time 
employed in circulating falsehoods about my father's 
family, and about myself. If I were to relate a 
thousandth part of them, it would fill up vol- 
umes. The persecution, however, became so intol- 
erable that I was under the necessiiy of leav- 
ing Manchester, and going with my wife to Sus- 
quehanna -county, in the state of Pennsylvania. 
While preparing to start, — ^being very poor, and the 
persecution so heavy upon us that there was no 
probability that we would ever be otherwise, — ^in 
the midst of our aflBictions we found a friend in a 
gentleman by the name of Martin Harris, who came 
to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our 
journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra 
township, Wayne county, in the state of New York, 
and a farmer of respectability. 

62. By this timely aid was I enabled to reach 
the place of my destination in Pennsylvania; and 
immediately after my arrival there I commenced 
copying the characters off the plates. I copied a 
considerable number of them, and by means of the 
TJrim and Thummim I translated some of them, 
which I did between the time I arrived at the house 
of my wife^s father, in the month of December, and 
the February following. 

63. Sometime in this month of February, the 
aforementioned Mr. Mirtin Harris came to our 







II.J WRITINGS OF JOSEPH SMITH. 97 

place, got the characters which I had drawn ofiE the 
plates, and started with them to the city of New 
York. For what took place relative to him and the 
characters, I refer to his own account of the circum- 
stances, as he related them to me after his return, 
which was as follows: 

64. I went to the city of New York, and pre- 
sented the characters which had been translated, 
with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles 
Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary 
attainments. Professor Anthon stated that the 
translation was correct, more so than any he had 
before seen translated from the Eg}^tian. I then 

. showed him those which were not yet translated, and 
he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, 
and Arabic; and he said they were true characters. 
He gave me a certificate, certifying to the people ot^ 
Palmyra that they were true characters, and that 
the translation of such of them as had been trans- 
lated were also correct. I took the certificate and 
put it into my pocket, and was just leaving the 
house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked 
me how the young man found out that there were 
gold plates in the place where he found them. I 
answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto 
him. 

65. He then said to me, "Let me see that cer- 
tificate.*' I accordingly took it out of my pocket 
and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to 
pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as 
ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the 
plates to him, he would translate them. I informed 
him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I 
was forbidden to bring thejn. He replied, "I can- 
not read a sealed book.'' I left him and went to Dr. 
Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon 
had said respecting both the characters and the 
translation.

66. On the 5th day of April, 1829, Oliver Cow- 
dery came to my house, until which time I had 
never seen him. He stated to me that having been 
teaching school in the neighborhood where my 
father resided, and my father being one of those who 
sent to the school, he went to board for a season at 
his house, and while there the family related to him 
the circumstance of my having received the plates, 
and accordingly he had come to make inquiries 
of me. 

67. Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery 
(being the 7th of April) I commenced to translate 
the Book of Mormon, and he began to write for me. 

68. We still continued the work of translation, 
when, in the ensuing month (May, 1829), we on a 
certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire 
of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of 
sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of 
the plates. While we were thus employed, praying 
and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven 
descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his 
hands upon us, he ordained us, sa3ring : 

69. Upon you my fellow servants, in the name 
of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which 
holds the heys of the ministering of angels, and of 
the Gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins; and this shall never 
be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi 
do offer again an offering unto the Lord in right- 
eousness, 

70. He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the 
power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us here- 
after; and he comihanded us to go and be baptized, 
and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver 
Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize 
me. 

71. Accordingly we went and were baptized. I

AVR^n^'c;s of ^rosEPii smith. DD 



baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me, 
— ^after which I laid my hands upon his head and 
ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, and after- 
wards he laid his hands on me and ordained me 
to the same priesthood — for so we were com- 
manded.^ 



6, Oliver Cowdery describes these events thus: "These were days 
never to be forgotten — to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the 
inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosomt 
Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as 
he translated with the Urim and Thummim, or, as the Nephites would 
have said, 'Int^reters/ the history or record called "The Book of 
Mormon.' 

"To notice, in even few words, the interesting account given by 
Mormon and his faithful son Moroni, of a people once beloved and fa- 
vored of heaven, would super^de my present design; I shall therefore 
defer this to a future periocl, and, as I said in the introduction, pass more 
directly^ to some few incidents immediately connected with the rise of 
this Church, which may be entertaining to some thousands who have 
stepped forward amid the frowns of bigots and the calumny of hypo- 
crites, and embraced the Gospel of Christ. 

"No men, in their sober senses, could translate and write the direc- 
tions given to the Nephites from the mouth of the Savior, of the precise 
manner in which men should build up His Church, and especially when 
corruption had spread an uncertainty over all forms and systems prac- 
ticed among men, without desiring a privilege of showing the willingness 
of the heart by being buried in the liquid grave, to answer a 'good con- 
science by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.' 

"After writing the account given of the Savior's ministry to the rem- 
nant of the seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easy to be seen, 
as the prophet said would be, that darkness covered the earth and gross 
darkness the minds of the people. On reflecting further it was easy to be 
seen, that amid the great strife and noise concerning religion, none had 
authority from God to administer the ordinances of the Gospel. For 
the question might be asked, have men authority to administer in the 
name of Christ, who deny revelations, when His testimony is no less than 
the spirit of prophecy, and His religion based, built, and sustained by 
immediate revelations in all ages of the world when He has had a peopte 
on earth? If these facts were buried, and carefulljr concealed b^f men 
whose craft would have been in danger if once permitted to shine in the 
faces of men, they were no longer to us; and we only waited for the com- 
mandment to be given 'Arise and be baptized.' 

"This was not long desired before it was realized. The Lord, who 
is rich in mercy, and ever willing to answer the consistent prayer of the 
humble, after we had called upon Him in a fervent manner, aside from 
the abodes of men, oondescenoed to manifest to us His will. On a sud- 
den, as from the midst of eternity, the voice of the Redeemer spsJce 
peace to us, while the veil was parted and the angel of God came down 
clothed with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked-for message, and 
the keys of the Gospel of repentance. What joyi what wonderl what 
amazement! While the world was racked and distracted — while millions 
were groping as the blind for the wall, and while all me^ were resting 
upon uncertainty, as a general mass, our eyes beheld, our ears heard, as 
in the 'blaze of day;' yes, more — above the glitter of the May sunbeam, 
which then shed its brilliancy over the face of nature! Then his voice, 
though mild, pierced to the center, and his words. 'I am thy fellow-

72. The messenger who visited us on this occa- 
sion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that 
his name was John, the same that is called John 
the Baptist in the New Testament^^ and that he 
acted under the direction of Peter, James, and John, 
who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchisedek, 
which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be 
conferred on us, and that I should he called the first 
Elder of the Church, and he (Olivet Cowdery) the 
second. It was on tiie fifteenth day of May, 1829, 
that Ve were ordained under the hand^of this mes- 
senger, and baptized. 

73. Immediately on our coming up out of the 
water after we had been baptized, we experienced 



servant,* dispelled every fear. We listened, we gased, we adxniredl 
'Twas the voice of an angel from glory, 'twas a message from, the Most 
High! And 8»we heard we rejoiced, -^nile His love enkindled upon our 
souls, and we were wrapped in the vision of the Almighty! Where was 
room for doubt? Nownere; uncertainty had fled, doubt had sunk no 
more to rise, while fiction and deception had fled forever! 

"But, dear brother, think, further think for a moment, what joy filled 
our hearts, and with what surprise we must have bowed, (for who would 
not have bowed the knee for such, a blessing?) when we received under 
his hand the Holy Priesthood as he said, 'Upon you my fellow-servants, 
in the name of Messiah, I confer this Priesthood and this authority, which 
shall remain upon earth, that the sons of Levi may yet offer an offering 
unto the Lord in righteousness!' 

"I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor 
the majestic beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; 
but you will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the 
eloquence of time, cannot begin to clothe language in as mteresting 
ancf sublime a manner as this holy personage. No; nor has this 
earth power to give the joy, to bestow the peace, or comprehend the 
wisdom which was contained in each sentence as they were delivered by 
the power of the Holy Spirit! Man may deceive his fellow-men, 
deception may follow deception, and the dbildren of the wicked one 
may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till nauj^t but 
fiction feeds the many, and the &amp;uit of falsehood carries in its current 
the giddy to the grave: but one touch with the finger of his love, 
yes, one ray of iJory nrom the upper world, or one word from the 
mouth of the Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into 
insignificance, and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance 
that we were in the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard 
the voice of Jesus, and the truth um^lied as it flowed from a pure 
personage, dictated by the will of God, is to me past description, and 
I shall ever look upMon this expression of the Savior's goodness with 
wonder and jthanksgiving while I am permitted to tarry; and in those 
mansions where pmection dwells and sin never oomes, I hope to 
adore in that day which shall never fljase.'* — Time9 and Seammt, 9.

great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly 
Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, 
than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood 
up and prophesied many things which should 
shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had 
been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of 
prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concern- 
ing the rise of this Church, and many other things 
connected with the Church, and this generation of 
the children of men. We were filled with the 
Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our sal- 
vation. 

74. Our minds being now enlightened, we began 
to have the scriptures laid open to our understandings, 
and the true meaning and intention of their more 
mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner 
which we never could attain to previously, nor ever 
before had thought of. In the meantime we were 
forced to keep secret the circumstances of having 
received the Priesthood and our having been bap- 
tized, owing to a spirit of persecution which had 
already manifested itself in the neighborhood. 

75. We had been threatened with being mobbed, 
from time to time, and this, too, by professors of 
religion. And their intentions of mobbing us were 
only counteracted by the influence of my wife^s 
father^s family (under Divine providence), who had 
become very friendly to me, and who were opposed 
to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed 
to continue the work of translation without inter- 
ruption; and therefore offered and promised us 
protection from all unlawful proceedings, as far as 
in them lay.

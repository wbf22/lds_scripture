Boil the flesh [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that [is] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus 8:32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus 8:33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation [in] seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
Leviticus 8:34	As he hath done this day, [so] the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
Leviticus 8:35	Therefore shall ye abide [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

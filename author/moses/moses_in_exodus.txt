Surely this thing is known.

for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

Here [am] I.

Who [am] I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? what shall I say unto them?

 But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

A rod.

O my Lord, I [am] not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I [am] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou wilt send.

Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which [are] in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.

Lord, wherefore hast thou [so] evil entreated this people? why [is] it [that] thou hast sent me?
Exodus 5:23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who [am] of uncircumcised lips?

Behold, I [am] of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the river only?

[Be it] according to thy word: that thou mayest know that [there is] none like unto the LORD our God.
Exodus 8:11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
Exodus 8:27	We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.


Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; [and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth [is] the LORD’S.
Exodus 9:30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.

We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we [must hold] a feast unto the LORD.

Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.
Exodus 10:26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this [place]: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
Exodus 13:4	This day came ye out in the month Abib.
Exodus 13:5	And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

Exodus 13:13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
Exodus 13:14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What [is] this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
Exodus 13:15	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
Exodus 13:16	And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.


Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
Exodus 14:14	The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

Exodus 15:18	The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
Exodus 15:19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry [land] in the midst of the sea.

If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I [am] the LORD that healeth thee.


At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
Exodus 16:7	And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what [are] we, that ye murmur against us?

[This shall be], when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what [are] we? your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.


Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.

This [is] the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
Exodus 16:16	This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, [according to] the number of your persons; take ye every man for [them] which [are] in his tents.


Let no man leave of it till the morning.

This [is that] which the LORD hath said, To morrow [is] the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to day], and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

Eat that to day; for to day [is] a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.
Exodus 16:26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is] the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

This [is] the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.


Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
Exodus 18:16	When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make [them] know the statutes of God, and his laws.


Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] wives.

The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.


Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.

Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur [are] with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
Exodus 32:12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

 What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

Who [is] on the LORD’S side? [let him come] unto me.


Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.


Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
Exodus 32:32	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
Exodus 33:13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation [is] thy people.

If thy presence go not [with me], carry us not up hence.
Exodus 33:16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? [is it] not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.

I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

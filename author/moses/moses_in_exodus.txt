Surely this thing is known.

for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

Here [am] I.

Who [am] I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? what shall I say unto them?

 But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

A rod.

O my Lord, I [am] not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I [am] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou wilt send.

Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which [are] in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.

Lord, wherefore hast thou [so] evil entreated this people? why [is] it [that] thou hast sent me?
Exodus 5:23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who [am] of uncircumcised lips?

Behold, I [am] of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the river only?

[Be it] according to thy word: that thou mayest know that [there is] none like unto the LORD our God.
Exodus 8:11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
Exodus 8:27	We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.


Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; [and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth [is] the LORD’S.
Exodus 9:30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.

We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we [must hold] a feast unto the LORD.

Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.
Exodus 10:26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

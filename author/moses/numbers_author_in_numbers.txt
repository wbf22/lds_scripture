Numbers 10:29	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father in law, 

Numbers 10:30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
Numbers 10:31	And he said, 

Numbers 10:33	And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.
Numbers 10:34	And the cloud of the LORD [was] upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
Numbers 10:35	And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, 

Numbers 10:36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.
Numbers 11:1	And [when] the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard [it]; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed [them that were] in the uttermost parts of the camp.
Numbers 11:2	And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.
Numbers 11:3	And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
Numbers 11:4	And the mixt multitude that [was] among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
Numbers 11:5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
Numbers 11:6	But now our soul [is] dried away: [there is] nothing at all, beside this manna, [before] our eyes.
Numbers 11:7	And the manna [was] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
Numbers 11:8	[And] the people went about, and gathered [it], and ground [it] in mills, or beat [it] in a mortar, and baked [it] in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
Numbers 11:9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
Numbers 11:10	Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
Numbers 11:11	And Moses said unto the LORD, 

Numbers 11:16	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 11:21	And Moses said, 

Numbers 11:23	And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
Numbers 11:24	And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.
Numbers 11:25	And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that [was] upon him, and gave [it] unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, [that], when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
Numbers 11:26	But there remained two [of the] men in the camp, the name of the one [was] Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they [were] of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers 11:27	And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
Numbers 11:28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, 

Numbers 11:29	And Moses said unto him, 

Numbers 11:30	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers 11:31	And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let [them] fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits [high] upon the face of the earth.
Numbers 11:32	And the people stood up all that day, and all [that] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread [them] all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
Numbers 11:33	And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
Numbers 11:34	And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers 11:35	[And] the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.
Numbers 12:1	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
Numbers 12:2	And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard [it].
Numbers 12:3	(Now the man Moses [was] very meek, above all the men which [were] upon the face of the earth.)
Numbers 12:4	And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, 

Numbers 12:5	And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
Numbers 12:6	And he said, Hear now my words: 

Numbers 12:9	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers 12:10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam [became] leprous, [white] as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, [she was] leprous.
Numbers 12:11	And Aaron said unto Moses, 

Numbers 12:13	And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying,

Numbers 12:14	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 12:15	And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in [again].
Numbers 12:16	And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers 13:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 13:3	And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads of the children of Israel.
Numbers 13:4	And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

Numbers 13:16	These [are] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
Numbers 13:17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, 

Numbers 13:21	So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
Numbers 13:22	And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers 13:23	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
Numbers 13:24	The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
Numbers 13:25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
Numbers 13:26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers 13:27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.
Numbers 13:28	Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
Numbers 13:29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
Numbers 13:30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
Numbers 13:31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we.
Numbers 13:32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature.
Numbers 13:33	And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [which come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
Numbers 14:1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
Numbers 14:2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers 14:3	And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
Numbers 14:4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
Numbers 14:5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers 14:6	And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
Numbers 14:7	And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding good land.
Numbers 14:8	If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
Numbers 14:9	Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not.
Numbers 14:10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
Numbers 14:11	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 14:13	And Moses said unto the LORD, 

Numbers 14:20	And the LORD said, 

Numbers 14:26	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,


Numbers 14:36	And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
Numbers 14:37	Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
Numbers 14:38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of the men that went to search the land, lived [still].
Numbers 14:39	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers 14:40	And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
Numbers 14:41	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
Numbers 14:42	Go not up, for the LORD [is] not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
Numbers 14:43	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
Numbers 14:44	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
Numbers 14:45	Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, [even] unto Hormah.
Numbers 15:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 15:17	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 15:32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.
Numbers 15:33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
Numbers 15:34	And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
Numbers 15:35	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 15:36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 15:37	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 16:1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:
Numbers 16:2	And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
Numbers 16:3	And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, [Ye take] too much upon you, seeing all the congregation [are] holy, every one of them, and the LORD [is] among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
Numbers 16:4	And when Moses heard [it], he fell upon his face:
Numbers 16:5	And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, 

Numbers 16:8	And Moses said unto Korah, 

Numbers 16:12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
Numbers 16:13	[Is it] a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
Numbers 16:14	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
Numbers 16:15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, 

Numbers 16:16	And Moses said unto Korah, 

Numbers 16:18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 16:19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
Numbers 16:20	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,


Numbers 16:22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, 

Numbers 16:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 16:25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers 16:26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, 

Numbers 16:27	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
Numbers 16:28	And Moses said, 

Numbers 16:31	And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that [was] under them:
Numbers 16:32	And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that [appertained] unto Korah, and all [their] goods.
Numbers 16:33	They, and all that [appertained] to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
Numbers 16:34	And all Israel that [were] round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up [also].
Numbers 16:35	And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
Numbers 16:36	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 16:39	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad [plates for] a covering of the altar:
Numbers 16:40	[To be] a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which [is] not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
Numbers 16:41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
Numbers 16:42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
Numbers 16:43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
Numbers 16:44	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 And they fell upon their faces.
Numbers 16:46	And Moses said unto Aaron, 

Numbers 16:47	And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
Numbers 16:48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers 16:49	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
Numbers 16:50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
Numbers 17:1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

Numbers 17:6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, [even] twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron [was] among their rods.
Numbers 17:7	And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
Numbers 17:8	And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
Numbers 17:9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
Numbers 17:10	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 17:11	And Moses did [so]: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
Numbers 17:12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
Numbers 17:13	Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
Numbers 18:1	And the LORD said unto Aaron, 

Numbers 18:8	And the LORD spake unto Aaron, 

Numbers 18:20	And the LORD spake unto Aaron, 

Numbers 20:1	Then came the children of Israel, [even] the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
Numbers 20:2	And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers 20:3	And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
Numbers 20:4	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
Numbers 20:5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it [is] no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither [is] there any water to drink.
Numbers 20:6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.
Numbers 20:7	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 20:9	And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
Numbers 20:10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, 

Numbers 20:11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts [also].
Numbers 20:12	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, 

Numbers 20:13	This [is] the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
Numbers 20:14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
Numbers 20:15	How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
Numbers 20:16	And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we [are] in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
Numbers 20:17	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s [high] way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
Numbers 20:18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
Numbers 20:19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without [doing] any thing [else], go through on my feet.
Numbers 20:20	And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
Numbers 20:21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
Numbers 20:22	And the children of Israel, [even] the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
Numbers 20:23	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,


Numbers 20:27	And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers 20:28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

Numbers 21:1	And [when] king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took [some] of them prisoners.
Numbers 21:2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Numbers 21:3	And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
Numbers 21:4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
Numbers 21:5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for [there is] no bread, neither [is there any] water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
Numbers 21:6	And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
Numbers 21:7	Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers 21:8	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 21:9	And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
Numbers 21:10	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
Numbers 21:11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which [is] before Moab, toward the sunrising.
Numbers 21:12	From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
Numbers 21:13	From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which [is] in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon [is] the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers 21:14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
Numbers 21:15	And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
Numbers 21:16	And from thence [they went] to Beer: that [is] the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, 

Numbers 21:17	Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
Numbers 21:18	The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah:
Numbers 21:19	And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
Numbers 21:20	And from Bamoth [in] the valley, that [is] in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
Numbers 21:21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers 21:22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of the well: [but] we will go along by the king’s [high] way, until we be past thy borders.
Numbers 21:23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
Numbers 21:24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was] strong.
Numbers 21:25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
Numbers 21:26	For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
Numbers 21:27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
Numbers 21:28	For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, [and] the lords of the high places of Arnon.
Numbers 21:29	Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:30	We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which [reacheth] unto Medeba.
Numbers 21:31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that [were] there.
Numbers 21:33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
Numbers 21:34	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 21:35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
Numbers 22:1	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan [by] Jericho.
Numbers 22:2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers 22:3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they [were] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
Numbers 22:4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time.
Numbers 22:5	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, 

Numbers 22:7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
Numbers 22:8	And he said unto them, 
 and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
Numbers 22:9	And God came unto Balaam, and said, 

Numbers 22:10	And Balaam said unto God, 

Numbers 22:12	And God said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 22:13	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, 

Numbers 22:14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
Numbers 22:15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
Numbers 22:16	And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, 

Numbers 22:18	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, 

Numbers 22:20	And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, 

Numbers 22:21	And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers 22:22	And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.
Numbers 22:23	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
Numbers 22:24	But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.
Numbers 22:25	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
Numbers 22:26	And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
Numbers 22:27	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
Numbers 22:28	And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
Numbers 22:29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
Numbers 22:30	And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
Numbers 22:31	Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
Numbers 22:32	And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:
Numbers 22:33	And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
Numbers 22:34	And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, 

Numbers 22:35	And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
Numbers 22:36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast.
Numbers 22:37	And Balak said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 22:38	And Balaam said unto Balak, 

Numbers 22:39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
Numbers 22:40	And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that [were] with him.
Numbers 22:41	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people.
Numbers 23:1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
Numbers 23:2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on [every] altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers 23:3	And Balaam said unto Balak, 
 And he went to an high place.
Numbers 23:4	And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, 

Numbers 23:5	And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, 

Numbers 23:6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
Numbers 23:7	And he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 23:11	And Balak said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 23:12	And he answered and said, 

Numbers 23:13	And Balak said unto him, 

Numbers 23:14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.
Numbers 23:15	And he said unto Balak, 

Numbers 23:16	And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, 

Numbers 23:17	And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
Numbers 23:18	And he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 23:25	And Balak said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 23:26	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, 

Numbers 23:27	And Balak said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 23:28	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
Numbers 23:29	And Balaam said unto Balak, 

Numbers 23:30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.
Numbers 24:1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers 24:2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding [in his tents] according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers 24:3	And he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 24:10	And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, 

Numbers 24:12	And Balaam said unto Balak, 

Numbers 24:15	And he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 24:20	And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 24:21	And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 24:23	And he took up his parable, and said, 

Numbers 24:25	And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
Numbers 25:1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
Numbers 25:2	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers 25:3	And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
Numbers 25:4	And the LORD said unto Moses, 

Numbers 25:5	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, 

Numbers 25:6	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who [were] weeping [before] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Numbers 25:7	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw [it], he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
Numbers 25:8	And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
Numbers 25:9	And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
Numbers 25:10	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 25:14	Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, [even] that was slain with the Midianitish woman, [was] Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
Numbers 25:15	And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain [was] Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he [was] head over a people, [and] of a chief house in Midian.
Numbers 25:16	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,


Numbers 26:1	And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,


Numbers 26:3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan [near] Jericho, saying,

Numbers 31:42	And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,

Numbers 32:3	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
Numbers 32:4	[Even] the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, [is] a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
Numbers 32:5	Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, [and] bring us not over Jordan.
Numbers 32:6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, 

Numbers 32:16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
Numbers 32:17	But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers 32:18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
Numbers 32:19	For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
Numbers 32:20	And Moses said unto them, 

Numbers 32:28	So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
Numbers 32:29	And Moses said unto them, 

Numbers 32:31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

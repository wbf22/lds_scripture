After
what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that
they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?

Alma 14:15
 15 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had
been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they
were of thy faith. 


Why do ye not answer the words of this people?  Know ye not
that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?

If ye have the power of God deliver
yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the
Lord will destroy this people according to your words.

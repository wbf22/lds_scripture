Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.


My wrong [be] upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.


I laughed not;

God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.

Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age.

Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac.

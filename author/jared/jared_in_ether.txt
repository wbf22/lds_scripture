Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may
not understand our words.


Cry again unto the Lord,
and it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are
our friends, that he confound not their language.

Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out
of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto
him whither we shall go.  And who knoweth but the Lord will carry
us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth?  And if
it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive
it for our inheritance.

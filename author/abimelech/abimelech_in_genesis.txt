Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
Genesis 20:5	Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?

Behold, my land [is] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.

Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved.


God [is] with thee in all that thou doest:
Genesis 21:23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: [but] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I [of it], but to day.

What [mean] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister?


What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.


He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.

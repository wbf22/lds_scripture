Why do ye not seize upon
this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according
to the crime which he has done?

Helaman 8:2
 2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this
people and against our law?



Why do you
suffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn
all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these
our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no
place in them.

Helaman 8:6
 6 And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are
powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no
power over us.


Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to
slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he
might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to
be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.

Helaman 9:17
 17 And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess
his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.

Thou art confederate; who is this man that
hath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault;
saying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee
thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement
which thou hast made with him.

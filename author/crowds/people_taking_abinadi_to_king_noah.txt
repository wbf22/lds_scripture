Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has
prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will
destroy them.

Mosiah 12:10
 10 And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith
that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.

Mosiah 12:11
 11 And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a
dry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and
trodden under foot.

Mosiah 12:12
 12 And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a
thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is
driven forth upon the face of the land.  And he pretendeth the
Lord hath spoken it.  And he saith all this shall come upon thee
except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.

Mosiah 12:13
 13 And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what
great sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned
of God or judged of this man?

Mosiah 12:14
 14 And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king,
hast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and
he has prophesied in vain.

Mosiah 12:15
 15 And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or
be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in
the land, and thou shalt also prosper.

Mosiah 12:16
 16 Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou
mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.

And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

Where [is] Sarah thy wife?

Genesis 18:10	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.


 Nay; but thou didst laugh.

And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring [them] out of this place:
Genesis 19:13	For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
Genesis 19:22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

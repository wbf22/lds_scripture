Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go?

Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

Behold, thou [art] with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis 16:12	And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is].
Genesis 21:18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.

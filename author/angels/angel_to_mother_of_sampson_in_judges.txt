Judges 13:3	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou [art] barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
Judges 13:4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean [thing]:
Judges 13:5	For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
Judges 13:14	She may not eat of any [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing]: all that I commanded her let her observe.


Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. 

Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it [is] secret?

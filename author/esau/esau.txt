Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage]; for I [am] faint: 

Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?

Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.

I [am] thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

Bless me, [even] me also, O my father.

Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met?


I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.

Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.

Let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me.

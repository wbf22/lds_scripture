What is that thou hast testified?  Hast thou seen an angel?  Why
do not angels appear unto us?  Behold are not this people as good
as thy people?

Alma 21:6
 6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish.  How
knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts?  How knowest
thou that we have cause to repent?  How knowest thou that we are
not a righteous people?  Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and
we do assemble ourselves together to worship God.  We do believe
that God will save all men.



We do not believe that thou knowest
any such thing.  We do not believe in these foolish traditions. 
We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do
we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know
concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.

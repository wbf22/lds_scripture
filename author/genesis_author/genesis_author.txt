and there was light.

Genesis 1:6	And God said,

Genesis 1:7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.

Genesis 1:9	And God said,

and it was so.

Genesis 1:29	And God said,

and it was so.


Genesis 1:31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Genesis 2:1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis 2:3	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
Genesis 2:4	These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.
Genesis 2:6	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis 2:7	And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Genesis 2:8	And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis 2:9	And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2:10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
Genesis 2:11	The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;
Genesis 2:12	And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.
Genesis 2:13	And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
Genesis 2:14	And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.
Genesis 2:15	And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
Genesis 2:16	And the LORD God commanded the man, saying,


Genesis 2:18	And the LORD God said, 

Genesis 2:19	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.
Genesis 2:20	And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
Genesis 2:21	And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
Genesis 2:22	And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
Genesis 2:23	And Adam said,

Genesis 2:24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
Genesis 2:25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Genesis 3:1	Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman,

Genesis 3:2	And the woman said unto the serpent,


Genesis 3:4	And the serpent said unto the woman, 

Genesis 3:6	And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
Genesis 3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
Genesis 3:8	And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3:9	And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, 

Genesis 3:10	And he said,


Genesis 3:11	And he said,


Genesis 3:12	And the man said, 


Genesis 3:13	And the LORD God said unto the woman,

And the woman said, 

Genesis 3:14	And the LORD God said unto the serpent,

Genesis 3:16	Unto the woman he said,

Genesis 3:17	And unto Adam he said,

Genesis 3:20	And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Genesis 3:21	Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
Genesis 3:22	And the LORD God said,


Genesis 3:23	Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
Genesis 3:24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Genesis 4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
Genesis 4:2	And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis 4:3	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
Genesis 4:4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
Genesis 4:5	But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
Genesis 4:6	And the LORD said unto Cain,

Genesis 4:8	And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
Genesis 4:9	And the LORD said unto Cain,

And he said,

Genesis 4:10	And he said,

Genesis 4:13	And Cain said unto the LORD,

Genesis 4:15	And the LORD said unto him,

And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
Genesis 4:16	And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

Genesis 6:22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Genesis 7:1	And the LORD said unto Noah,

Genesis 7:5	And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
Genesis 7:6	And Noah [was] six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
Genesis 7:7	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Genesis 7:8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that [are] not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
Genesis 7:9	There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
Genesis 7:10	And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
Genesis 7:11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

Genesis 7:13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
Genesis 7:14	They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
Genesis 7:15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life.
Genesis 7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
Genesis 7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
Genesis 7:18	And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

Genesis 7:20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Genesis 7:21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
Genesis 7:22	All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land], died.
Genesis 7:23	And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive], and they that [were] with him in the ark.
Genesis 7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Genesis 8:1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
Genesis 8:2	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
Genesis 8:3	And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
Genesis 8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis 8:5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
Genesis 8:6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
Genesis 8:7	And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
Genesis 8:8	Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
Genesis 8:9	But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
Genesis 8:10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
Genesis 8:11	And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
Genesis 8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
Genesis 8:13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
Genesis 8:14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
Genesis 8:15	And God spake unto Noah, saying,

Genesis 8:18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:
Genesis 8:19	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
Genesis 8:20	And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis 8:21	And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart,

Genesis 9:1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them,

Genesis 9:8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham [is] the father of Canaan.
Genesis 9:19	These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
Genesis 9:20	And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
Genesis 9:21	And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
Genesis 9:22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Genesis 9:23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
Genesis 9:24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
Genesis 9:25	And he said,


Genesis 9:28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis 9:29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.

Genesis 10:9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
Genesis 10:10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

Genesis 11:1	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
Genesis 11:2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Genesis 11:3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
Genesis 11:4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis 11:5	And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Genesis 11:6	And the LORD said,

Genesis 11:8	So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

Genesis 11:32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis 12:1	Now the LORD had said unto Abram, 

Genesis 12:4	So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis 12:5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis 12:6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.
Genesis 12:7	And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said,


and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
Genesis 12:8	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis 12:9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
Genesis 12:10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.
Genesis 12:11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife,

Genesis 12:14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair.
Genesis 12:15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis 12:16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
Genesis 12:17	And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
Genesis 12:18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife?
Genesis 12:19	Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her], and go thy way.
Genesis 12:20	And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
Genesis 13:1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
Genesis 13:2	And Abram [was] very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis 13:3	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
Genesis 13:4	Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis 13:5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis 13:6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis 13:7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
Genesis 13:8	And Abram said unto Lot,


Genesis 13:10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it [was] well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [even] as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
Genesis 13:11	Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis 13:12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom.
Genesis 13:13	But the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
Genesis 13:14	And the LORD said unto Abram, 

Genesis 13:18	Then Abram removed [his] tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which [is] in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
Genesis 14:1	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
Genesis 14:2	[That these] made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
Genesis 14:3	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Genesis 14:4	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis 14:5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that [were] with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
Genesis 14:6	And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which [is] by the wilderness.
Genesis 14:7	And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which [is] Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
Genesis 14:8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis 14:9	With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
Genesis 14:10	And the vale of Siddim [was full of] slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis 14:11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis 14:12	And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Genesis 14:13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these [were] confederate with Abram.
Genesis 14:14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained [servants], born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] unto Dan.
Genesis 14:15	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which [is] on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis 14:16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Genesis 14:17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that [were] with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king’s dale.
Genesis 14:18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was] the priest of the most high God.
Genesis 14:19	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis 14:20	And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
Genesis 14:21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis 14:22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom,

Genesis 15:1	After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, 

enesis 15:3	And Abram said,


Genesis 15:4	And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying,


Genesis 15:5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said,

Genesis 15:6	And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Genesis 15:7	And he said unto him,


Genesis 15:6	And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Genesis 15:7	And he said unto him,

Genesis 15:8	And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis 15:9	And he said unto him,


Genesis 15:10	And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis 15:11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
Genesis 15:12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis 15:13	And he said unto Abram, 

Genesis 15:17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
Genesis 15:18	In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,

Genesis 16:1	Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name [was] Hagar.
Genesis 16:2	And Sarai said unto Abram, 

And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis 16:3	And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
Genesis 16:4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis 16:5	And Sarai said unto Abram,


Genesis 16:6	But Abram said unto Sarai,

And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
Genesis 16:7	And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis 16:8	And he said,

And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

Genesis 16:9	And the angel of the LORD said unto her, 

Genesis 16:10	And the angel of the LORD said unto her,

Genesis 16:11	And the angel of the LORD said unto her,

Genesis 16:13	And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis 16:14	Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, [it is] between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis 16:15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis 16:16	And Abram [was] fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis 17:1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him,

Genesis 17:3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

Genesis 17:9	And God said unto Abraham, 

Genesis 17:15	And God said unto Abraham,


Genesis 17:18	And Abraham said unto God, 

Genesis 17:19	And God said,

Genesis 17:22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis 17:23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Genesis 17:24	And Abraham [was] ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis 17:25	And Ishmael his son [was] thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis 17:26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis 17:27	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Genesis 18:1	And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis 18:2	And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,


Genesis 18:6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said,

Genesis 18:7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis 18:8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Genesis 18:9	And they said unto him, 

 And he said, 

 And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him.
Genesis 18:11	Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis 18:12	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis 18:13	And the LORD said unto Abraham, 

Genesis 18:15	Then Sarah denied, saying, 


for she was afraid. And he said,
Genesis 18:16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis 18:17	And the LORD said,

Genesis 18:20	And the LORD said,

Genesis 18:22	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
Genesis 18:23	And Abraham drew near, and said, 

Genesis 18:26	And the LORD said, 

Genesis 18:27	And Abraham answered and said,


Genesis 18:30	And he said [unto him], 

Genesis 18:33	And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
Genesis 19:1	And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
Genesis 19:2	And he said,

Genesis 19:3	And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Genesis 19:4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
Genesis 19:5	And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Genesis 19:6	And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
Genesis 19:7	And said,

Genesis 19:9	And they said, Stand back. And they said [again], This one [fellow] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, [even] Lot, and came near to break the door.
Genesis 19:10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Genesis 19:11	And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Genesis 19:12	And the men said unto Lot,

Genesis 19:14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
Genesis 19:15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,

Genesis 19:16	And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Genesis 19:17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said,

Genesis 19:18	And Lot said unto them, 

Genesis 19:21	And he said unto him, 


Genesis 19:23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Genesis 19:24	Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
Genesis 19:25	And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Genesis 19:26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis 19:27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
Genesis 19:28	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis 19:29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
Genesis 19:30	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis 19:31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Genesis 19:32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis 19:35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis 19:36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis 19:37	And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Genesis 19:38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Genesis 20:1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis 20:2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,


and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Genesis 20:3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, 

Genesis 20:4	But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said,
Genesis 20:6	And God said unto him in a dream,

Genesis 20:8	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
Genesis 20:9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him,

Genesis 20:10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham,

Genesis 20:11	And Abraham said,

Genesis 20:14	And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave [them] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Genesis 20:15	And Abimelech said,

Genesis 20:16	And unto Sarah he said,

Genesis 20:17	So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare [children].
Genesis 20:18	For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.
Genesis 21:1	And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Genesis 21:2	For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis 21:3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Genesis 21:4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21:5	And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Genesis 21:6	And Sarah said,

Genesis 21:7	And she said,

Genesis 21:8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the [same] day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis 21:9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
Genesis 21:10	Wherefore she said unto Abraham,

Genesis 21:11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
Genesis 21:12	And God said unto Abraham,

Genesis 21:14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Genesis 21:15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Genesis 21:16	And she went, and sat her down over against [him] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lift up her voice, and wept.
Genesis 21:17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her,

Genesis 21:19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Genesis 21:20	And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
Genesis 21:21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21:22	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying,


Genesis 21:24	And Abraham said, 

Genesis 21:25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
Genesis 21:26	And Abimelech said,

Genesis 21:27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
Genesis 21:28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis 21:29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham,

Genesis 21:30	And he said, 

Genesis 21:31	Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
Genesis 21:32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21:33	And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
Genesis 21:34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.

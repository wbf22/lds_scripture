I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

Behold, I have not told [it] my father nor my mother, and shall I tell [it] thee?


Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?


If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.


 If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

 If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

There hath not come a rasor upon mine head; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man.

I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself.

Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.

O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

Let me die with the Philistines.

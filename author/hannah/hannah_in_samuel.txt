O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head.


No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
1 Samuel 1:16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.

Because I have asked him of the LORD.

[I will not go up] until the child be weaned, and [then] I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
1 Samuel 1:27	For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
1 Samuel 1:28	Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.

My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1 Samuel 2:2	[There is] none holy as the LORD: for [there is] none beside thee: neither [is there] any rock like our God.
1 Samuel 2:3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let [not] arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD [is] a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
1 Samuel 2:4	The bows of the mighty men [are] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1 Samuel 2:5	[They that were] full have hired out themselves for bread; and [they that were] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
1 Samuel 2:6	The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
1 Samuel 2:7	The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
1 Samuel 2:8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set [them] among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.
1 Samuel 2:9	He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
1 Samuel 2:10	The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at
this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I
did your brethren.  Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our
fathers have spoken.




Where is this man that has such great power?


Surely there has not been any
servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this
man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute
them.

Alma 18:11
 11 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would
desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.




Who art thou?  Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows
all things?


How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?

Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things;
and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of
my brethren that scattered my flocks--

Alma 18:21
 21 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things,
whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were
needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou
art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou
desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.

Yea, I will believe all
thy words.


I do not know what that
meaneth.

Yea, I believe that he created all things which
are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.

Is it above the earth?

I believe all these things which thou
hast spoken.  Art thou sent from God?


O Lord, have
mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon
the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.


Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art
thou.

Alma 19:13
 13 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer;
and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall
redeem all mankind who believe on his name.


I know, in the strength of the
Lord thou canst do all things.  But behold, I will go with thee
to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni,
whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to
the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and
he will cast thy brethren out of prison.



Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?

Come, I will go with thee down to the
land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he
will cast thy brethren out of prison.

I will not slay Ammon, neither will
I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni
that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they
are just men and holy prophets of the true God.

We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
Genesis 3:3	But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.


For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

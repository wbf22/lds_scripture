I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.


In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
Genesis 41:18	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
Genesis 41:19	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
Genesis 41:20	And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Genesis 41:21	And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Genesis 41:22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
Genesis 41:23	And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
Genesis 41:24	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.

Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?

Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]:
Genesis 41:40	Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.


Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Genesis 45:18	And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Genesis 45:19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis 45:20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.

What [is] your occupation? 

 Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Genesis 47:6	The land of Egypt [is] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest [any] men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

How old [art] thou?


Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

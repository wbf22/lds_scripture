Will
ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?



Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I

Thou sayest there is a true and
living God?


Is there more than one God?



How knowest thou these
things?

Son of God?



Shall he save his people in their
sins?

things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the
Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as

resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both

God. 



Yea, I believe all the words that
thou hast taught.


Yea, I believe according to thy words.

Who is
Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is
the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?

Mosiah 11:28
 28 I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him,
for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to
anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people;
therefore I will slay him.





Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to
do with him, for he is mad.




Abinadi, we have found an accusation
against thee, and thou art worthy of death.

Mosiah 17:8
 8 For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the
children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to
death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast
spoken evil concerning me and my people.




Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will
destroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.

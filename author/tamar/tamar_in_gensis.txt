What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thou send [it]?

Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thine hand.

By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

Behold, the people of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we:
Exodus 1:10	Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of the land.

When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live.

Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

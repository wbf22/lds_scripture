Let us not kill him.


Shed no blood, [but] cast him into this pit that [is] in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;

The child [is] not; and I, whither shall I go?


Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

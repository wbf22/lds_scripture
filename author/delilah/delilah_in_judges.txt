Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength [lieth], and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.


The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson.


Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.

The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And [there were] liers in wait abiding in the chamber.

Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.

The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson.

How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth].


Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. 

The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson.

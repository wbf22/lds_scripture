Who [is] Abimelech, and who [is] Shechem, that we should serve him? [is] not [he] the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
Judges 9:29	And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.

Increase thine army, and come out.

Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains.

See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.

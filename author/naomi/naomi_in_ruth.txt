Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
Ruth 1:9	The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each [of you] in the house of her husband.

Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? [are] there yet [any more] sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth 1:12	Turn again, my daughters, go [your way]; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, [if] I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
Ruth 1:13	Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.

Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth 1:21	I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why [then] call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?


Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find grace. 

Go, my daughter.

Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.

Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.

The man [is] near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.

[It is] good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.

My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
Ruth 3:2	And now [is] not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
Ruth 3:3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: [but] make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
Ruth 3:4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.

All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

Who [art] thou, my daughter?


Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.

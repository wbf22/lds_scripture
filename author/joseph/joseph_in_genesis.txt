 Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
Genesis 37:7	For, behold, we [were] binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.


I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks].


Behold, my master wotteth not what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
Genesis 39:9	[There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

Wherefore look ye [so] sadly to day?

[Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [them], I pray you.

The three branches [are] three days:
Genesis 40:13	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
Genesis 40:14	But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
Genesis 40:15	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

This [is] the interpretation thereof: The three baskets [are] three days:
Genesis 40:19	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

[It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.


The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.
Genesis 41:26	The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.
Genesis 41:27	And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis 41:28	This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
Genesis 41:30	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Genesis 41:31	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.
Genesis 41:32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Genesis 41:33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:34	Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
Genesis 41:35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
Genesis 41:36	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.


For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.

For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

Whence come ye?

Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

That [is it] that I spake unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies:

By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Genesis 42:16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there be any] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are] spies.

This do, and live; [for] I fear God:
Genesis 42:19	If ye [be] true [men], let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
Genesis 42:20	But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

Bring [these] men home, and slay, and make ready; for [these] men shall dine with me at noon.

Peace [be] to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.

[Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? [Is] he yet alive?

[Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

Fill the men’s sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
Genesis 44:2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.

 Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis 44:5	[Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

What deed [is] this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

God forbid that I should do so: [but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

Cause every man to go out from me.

I [am] Joseph; doth my father yet live?

Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I [am] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Genesis 45:5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Genesis 45:6	For these two years [hath] the famine [been] in the land: and yet [there are] five years, in the which [there shall] neither [be] earing nor harvest.
Genesis 45:7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
Genesis 45:8	So now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 45:9	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
Genesis 45:10	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Genesis 45:11	And there will I nourish thee; for yet [there are] five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
Genesis 45:12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Genesis 45:13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

See that ye fall not out by the way.

I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which [were] in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Genesis 46:32	And the men [are] shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Genesis 46:33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What [is] your occupation?
Genesis 46:34	That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, [and] also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.

Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.

Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, [here is] seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Genesis 47:24	And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth [part] unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.

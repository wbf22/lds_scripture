Omni 1:9
 9 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same
book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote,
that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day
that he delivered them unto me.  And after this manner we keep
the records, for it is according to the commandments of our
fathers.  And I make an end.

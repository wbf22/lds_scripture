Now O king, thou hast hitherto
hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending
with our brethren, the Lamanites.

Mosiah 22:4
 4 And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an
unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my
words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even
so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time,
and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.

Mosiah 22:5
 5 And the king granted unto him that he might speak.  And Gideon
said unto him:

Mosiah 22:6
 6 Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side
of the city.  The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by
night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all
this people that they gather together their flocks and herds,
that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.

Mosiah 22:7
 7 And I will go according to thy command and pay the last
tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and
we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp
when they are drunken and asleep.

Mosiah 22:8
 8 Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our
flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel
around the land of Shilom.

Sell me this day thy birthright.

Swear to me this day;


Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man:
Genesis 27:12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

Because the LORD thy God brought [it] to me.

Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew [it] not.
Genesis 28:17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this [is] none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven.

If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Genesis 28:21	So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
Genesis 28:22	And this stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

My brethren, whence [be] ye?

Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? 

[Is] he well?


Lo, [it is] yet high day, neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go [and] feed [them].

I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

 What [is] this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?


[Am] I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis 30:26	Give [me] my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
Genesis 30:30	For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came], and it is [now] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock:
Genesis 30:32	I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.
Genesis 30:33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

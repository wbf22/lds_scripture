Sell me this day thy birthright.

Swear to me this day;


Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man:
Genesis 27:12	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

Because the LORD thy God brought [it] to me.

Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew [it] not.
Genesis 28:17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this [is] none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven.

If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Genesis 28:21	So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
Genesis 28:22	And this stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

My brethren, whence [be] ye?

Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? 

[Is] he well?


Lo, [it is] yet high day, neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go [and] feed [them].

I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

 What [is] this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?


[Am] I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis 30:26	Give [me] my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
Genesis 30:30	For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came], and it is [now] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock:
Genesis 30:32	I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.
Genesis 30:33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

I see your father’s countenance, that it [is] not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Genesis 31:6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis 31:7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Genesis 31:8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
Genesis 31:9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given [them] to me.
Genesis 31:10	And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle [were] ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.


Genesis 31:11	And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, [saying], Jacob: And I said, Here [am] I.
Genesis 31:12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle [are] ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Genesis 31:13	I [am] the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, [and] where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.


Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
Genesis 31:32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what [is] thine with me, and take [it] to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

What [is] my trespass? what [is] my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
Genesis 31:37	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
Genesis 31:38	This twenty years [have] I [been] with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
Genesis 31:39	That which was torn [of beasts] I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night.
Genesis 31:40	[Thus] I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
Genesis 31:41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Genesis 31:42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked [thee] yesternight.

Behold this heap, and behold [this] pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
Genesis 31:52	This heap [be] witness, and [this] pillar [be] witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Genesis 31:53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us.


This [is] God’s host:

Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
Genesis 32:5	And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.


O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
Genesis 32:10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
Genesis 32:11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.
Genesis 32:12	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.


Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Genesis 32:17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?
Genesis 32:18	Then thou shalt say, [They be] thy servant Jacob’s; it [is] a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us.

Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.

[These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord.

Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Genesis 33:11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.

My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
Genesis 33:14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.


Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I [being] few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.


Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
Genesis 35:3	And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

Do not thy brethren feed [the flock] in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.

Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again.

[It is] my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

Why do ye look one upon another?

I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

Me have ye bereaved [of my children]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against me.


My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

Go again, buy us a little food.

Wherefore dealt ye [so] ill with me, [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

If [it must be] so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
Genesis 43:12	And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it] again in your hand; peradventure it [was] an oversight:
Genesis 43:13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Genesis 43:14	And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved [of my children], I am bereaved.

[It is] enough; Joseph my son [is] yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.


 Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou [art] yet alive.

The days of the years of my pilgrimage [are] an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.


If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
Genesis 47:30	But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Genesis 47:31	And he said, Swear unto me.

God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis 48:4	And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.
Genesis 48:5	And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, [are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
Genesis 48:6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Genesis 48:7	And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet [there was] but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same [is] Bethlehem.

Who [are] these?

I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.


God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
Genesis 48:16	The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

I know [it], my son, I know [it]: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Genesis 48:22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the last days.
Genesis 49:2	Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Genesis 49:3	Reuben, thou [art] my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Genesis 49:4	Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou [it]: he went up to my couch.
Genesis 49:5	Simeon and Levi [are] brethren; instruments of cruelty [are in] their habitations.
Genesis 49:6	O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
Genesis 49:7	Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Genesis 49:8	Judah, thou [art he] whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand [shall be] in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.
Genesis 49:9	Judah [is] a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
Genesis 49:10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him [shall] the gathering of the people [be].
Genesis 49:11	Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
Genesis 49:12	His eyes [shall be] red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Genesis 49:13	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he [shall be] for an haven of ships; and his border [shall be] unto Zidon.
Genesis 49:14	Issachar [is] a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
Genesis 49:15	And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [it was] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Genesis 49:16	Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis 49:17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
Genesis 49:18	I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
Genesis 49:19	Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
Genesis 49:20	Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
Genesis 49:21	Naphtali [is] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Genesis 49:22	Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a well; [whose] branches run over the wall:
Genesis 49:23	The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and hated him:
Genesis 49:24	But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob; (from thence [is] the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
Genesis 49:25	[Even] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
Genesis 49:26	The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Genesis 49:27	Benjamin shall ravin [as] a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that [is] in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis 49:30	In the cave that [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is] before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
Genesis 49:31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
Genesis 49:32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that [is] therein [was] from the children of Heth.

If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis 50:5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

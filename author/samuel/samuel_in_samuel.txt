If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, [then] put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.


Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.


Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.

This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots.

1 Samuel 8:13	And he will take your daughters [to be] confectionaries, and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers.
1 Samuel 8:14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, [even] the best [of them], and give [them] to his servants.
1 Samuel 8:15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1 Samuel 8:16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work.
1 Samuel 8:17	He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
1 Samuel 8:18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

Go ye every man unto his city.

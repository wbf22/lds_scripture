Drink, my lord:

I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.

And she said, I will go.


What man [is] this that walketh in the field to meet us? 


If [it be] so, why [am] I thus?

Drink, my lord:

I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.

And she said, I will go.


What man [is] this that walketh in the field to meet us? 


If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? 

Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Genesis 27:7	Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
Genesis 27:8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Genesis 27:9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
Genesis 27:10	And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

Upon me [be] thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me [them].

Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.


Genesis 27:43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
Genesis 27:44	And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;
Genesis 27:45	Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

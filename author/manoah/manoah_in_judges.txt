O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and [how] shall we do unto him?

I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

What [is] thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?


We shall surely die, because we have seen God.

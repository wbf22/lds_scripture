Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis 12:12	Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis 12:13	Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.


Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we [be] brethren.
Genesis 13:9	[Is] not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if [thou depart] to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis 14:23	That I will not [take] from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that [is] thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis 14:24	Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.


Genesis 15:2	And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus?

Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.


Behold, thy maid [is] in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee.


Genesis 17:17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

O that Ishmael might live before thee!

Genesis 18:3	And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis 18:4	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis 18:5	And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant.

Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it], and make cakes upon the hearth.

Behold, in the tent.

Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis 18:24	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein?
Genesis 18:25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes:
Genesis 18:28	Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].
Genesis 18:29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty’s sake.

Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there.
Genesis 18:31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty’s sake.
Genesis 18:32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten’s sake.

She [is] my sister: 

Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
Genesis 20:12	And yet indeed [she is] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

Genesis 20:13	And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This [is] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.

I will swear.

For [these] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

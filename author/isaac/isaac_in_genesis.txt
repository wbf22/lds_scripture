My father:

Behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering?


She [is] my sister:


Because I said, Lest I die for her.

Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?

 My son:

Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
Genesis 27:3	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me [some] venison;
Genesis 27:4	And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son?

How [is it] that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son?

Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou [be] my very son Esau or not.

The voice [is] Jacob’s voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau.

[Art] thou my very son Esau?

Bring [it] near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee.


See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
Genesis 27:28	Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
Genesis 27:29	Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed [be] every one that curseth thee, and blessed [be] he that blesseth thee.

Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed.


Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.


Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis 28:2	Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
Genesis 28:3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
Genesis 28:4	And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and
I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be
separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and
forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me
that I may have mercy upon them.

Alma 3:15
 15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed
with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.

Alma 3:16
 16 And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against
thee and thy seed.

Alma 3:17
 17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be
called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be
called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the
promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.

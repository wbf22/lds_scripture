Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me:

Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.

If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
Numbers 22:19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.


Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee.

I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [every] altar a bullock and a ram.

Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying], Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
Numbers 23:8	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, [whom] the LORD hath not defied?
Numbers 23:9	For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
Numbers 23:10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth [part] of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet [the LORD] yonder.

Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
Numbers 23:19	God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
Numbers 23:20	Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
Numbers 23:21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God [is] with him, and the shout of a king [is] among them.
Numbers 23:22	God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
Numbers 23:23	Surely [there is] no enchantment against Jacob, neither [is there] any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
Numbers 23:24	Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat [of] the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
Numbers 24:4	He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance], but having his eyes open:
Numbers 24:5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, [and] thy tabernacles, O Israel!
Numbers 24:6	As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, [and] as cedar trees beside the waters.
Numbers 24:7	He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed [shall be] in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
Numbers 24:8	God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce [them] through with his arrows.
Numbers 24:9	He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed [is] he that blesseth thee, and cursed [is] he that curseth thee.

I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed [them] these three times.
Numbers 24:11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.

Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
Numbers 24:13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do [either] good or bad of mine own mind; [but] what the LORD saith, that will I speak?
Numbers 24:14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come [therefore, and] I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
Numbers 24:16	He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, [which] saw the vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance], but having his eyes open:
Numbers 24:17	I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
Numbers 24:18	And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
Numbers 24:19	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.

Amalek [was] the first of the nations; but his latter end [shall be] that he perish for ever.

Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
Numbers 24:22	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.


Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
Numbers 24:24	And ships [shall come] from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

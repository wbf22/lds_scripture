THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES to the Book of 
the Lord's Commandments, which He gave to His Church through 
Joseph Smith, Jun., who was appointed by the voice of the Church 
for this purpose: 

We, therefore, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world 
of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth and 
upon the islands of the sea, that the Lord has borne record to our 
souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these com- 
mandments were given by inspiration of God, and are profitable 
for all men, and are verily true. 

We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our 
helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father, and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of 
bearing this testimony unto the world, that the children of men 
may be profited thereby.*

Martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and his brother, Hyrum 
Smith the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844. See History 
of the Church, vol. 6, p. 612. 



1. To seal the testimony of this 
book and the Book of Mormon, we 
announce the martyrdom of Jo- 
seph Smith the Prophet, and Hy- 
rum Smith the Patriarch. They 
were shot in Carthage jail, on the 
27th of June, 1844, about five 
o'clock p. m., by an armed mob — 
painted black — of from 150 to 
200 persons. Hyrum was shot 
first and fell calmly, exclaiming: 
I am a dead man! Joseph leaped 
from the window, and was shot 
dead in the attempt, exclaiming: 
Lord my God! They were both 
shot after they were dead, in a 
brutal manner, and both received 
four balls. 

2. John Taylor and Willard 
Richards, two of the Twelve, were 
the only persons in the room at 
the time; the former was wounded 
in a savage manner with four 
balls, but has since recovered; 
the latter, through the providence 
of God, escaped, without even a 
hole in his robe. 



3. Joseph Smith, the Prophet 
and Seer of the Lord, has done 
more, save Jesus only, for the 
salvation of men in this world, 
than any other man that ever 
lived in it. In the short space of 
twenty years, he has brought 
forth the Book of Mormon, which 
he translated by the gift and 
power of God, and has been the 
means of publishing it on two 
continents; has sent the fulness 
of the everlasting gospel, which 
it contained, to the four quarters 
of the earth; has brought forth 
the revelations and command- 
ments which compose this book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, and 
many other wise documents and 
instructions for the benefit of the 
children of men; gathered many 
thousands of the Latter-day 
Saints, founded a great city, and 
left a fame and name that can- 
not be slain. He lived great, and 
he died great in the eyes of God 
and his people; and like most of

the Lord's anointed in ancient 
times, has sealed his mission and 
his works with his own blood; 
and so has his brother Hyrum. 
In life they were not divided, and 
in death they were not sepa- 
rated ! 

4. When Joseph went to Car- 
thage to deliver himself up to the 
pretended requirements of the 
law, two or three days previous 
to his assassination, he said: "I 
am going like a lamb to the 
slaughter; but I am calm as a 
summer's morning; I have a con- 
science void of offense towards 
God, and towards all men. I 

SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL 
YET BE SAID OF ME — HE WAS MUR- 
DERED in cold blood." — The same 
morning, after Hyrum had made 
ready to go — shall it be said to 
the slaughter? yes, for so it was 
— he read the following para- 
graph, near the close of the 
twelfth chapter of Ether, in the 
Book of Mormon, and turned 
down the leaf upon it: 

5. And it came to pass that I 
prayed unto the Lord that he 
would give unto the Gentiles grace, 
that they might have charity. And 
it came to pass that the Lord said 
unto me: If they have not charity 
it mattereth not unto thee, thou 
hast been faithful; wherefore thy 
garments are clean. And because 
thou hast seen thy weakness, thou 
shalt be made strong, even unto the 
sitting down in the place which I 
have prepared in the mansions of 
my Father. And now I . . . . bid 
farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, 
and also unto my brethren whom 
I love, until we shall meet before 
the judgment-seat of Christ, where 
all men shall know that my gar- 
ments are not spotted with your 
blood. The testators are now 
dead, and their testament is in 
force. 



6. Hyrum Smith was forty-four 
years old in February, 1844, and 
Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in 
December, 1843; and hencefor- 
ward their names will be classed 
among the martyrs of religion; 
and the reader in every nation 
will be reminded that the Book 
of Mormon, and this book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants of the church, 
cost the best blood of the nine- 
teenth century to bring them 
forth for the salvation of a ruined 
world; and that if the fire can 
scathe a green tree for the glory 
of God, how easy it will burn up 
the dry trees to purify the vine- 
yard of corruption. They lived 
for glory; they died for glory; 
and glory is their eternal reward. 
From age to age shall their names 
go down to posterity as gems for 
the sanctified. 

7. They were innocent of any 
crime, as they had often been 
proved before, and were only con- 
fined in jail by the conspiracy of 
traitors and wicked men; and 
their innocent blood on the floor 
of Carthage jail is a broad seal 
affixed to "Mormonism" that can- 
not be rejected by any court on 
earth, and their innocent blood on 
the escutcheon of the State of 
Illinois, with the broken faith of 
the State as pledged by the gov- 
ernor, is a witness to the truth of 
the everlasting gospel that all the 
world cannot impeach; and their 
innocent blood on the banner of 
liberty, and on the magna charta 
of the United States, is an am- 
bassador for the religion of Jesus 
Christ, that will touch the hearts 
of honest men among all nations; 
and their innocent blood, with the 
innocent blood of all the martyrs 
under the altar that John saw, 
will cry unto the Lord of Hosts 
till he avenges that blood on the 
earth. Amen.

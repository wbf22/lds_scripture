Mosiah 27:24
 24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been
redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.

Mosiah 27:25
 25 And the Lord said unto me: 




and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.

Mosiah 27:28
 28 Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulations,
repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to
snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.

Mosiah 27:29
 29 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and
bonds of iniquity.  I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold
the marvelous light of God.  My soul was racked with eternal
torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.

Mosiah 27:30
 30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken
of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will
come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he
will make himself manifest unto all.

Mosiah 27:31
 31 Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before
him.  Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be
judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall
they confess, who live without God in the world, that the
judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they
shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his
all-searching eye.

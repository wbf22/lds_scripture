The servants of my husband have made it
known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that
thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;

Alma 19:5
 5 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in
and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the
space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not
dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and
that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself,
to me he doth not stink.



I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of
our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according
as thou hast said.


O blessed Jesus, who has
saved me from an awful hell!  O blessed God, have mercy on this
people!

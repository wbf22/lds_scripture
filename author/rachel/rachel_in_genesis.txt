Give me children, or else I die.

Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.

God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.


With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed:

Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.

Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.

God hath taken away my reproach:

The LORD shall add to me another son.

Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women [is] upon me.

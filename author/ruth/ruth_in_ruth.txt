Intreat me not to leave thee, [or] to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people [shall be] my people, and thy God my God:
Ruth 1:17	Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, [if ought] but death part thee and me.

I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves:

Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a stranger?

Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

I [am] Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou [art] a near kinsman.

These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

Blessed [be] the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
Ruth 4:15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of [thy] life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

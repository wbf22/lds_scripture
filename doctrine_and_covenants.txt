EXPLANATORY INTRODUCTION 



THE Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized 
as an institution among men on the sixth day of April, 1830. 
Through a period of more than six years prior to that date, Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, had received at intervals Divine revelations and 
commandments. 

Of these, the first and of all most glorious was the visitation in which, 
in answer to the young man's prayer for guidance as to which of the 
numerous and opposing sects of the day he should join, the Eternal 
Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, personally manifested themselves, 
and the Father, pointing to the Christ, thus affirmed and commanded: 
This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him ! a 

This took place in the early spring of 1820. In September, 1823, 
and at later times, Joseph Smith received visitations from Moroni, 
an angel of light, who revealed the resting place of the ancient record 
from which The Book of Mormon was afterward translated. 6 

Many revelations followed, in preparation for the re-establishment 
of the Church of Jesus Christ on earth, and, later, for the direction of 
the Church so organized. As early as the summer of 1830, the Prophet, 
acting under Divine commandment, was engaged in copying and 
arranging the revelations received up to that time, evidently with a 
view to their publication in book form. On November 1, 1831, at a 
conference of the Elders of the Church held at Hiram, Ohio, definite 
action relating to the publication of the revelations was taken, and the 
compilation was called the Book of Commandments. The Lord's accep- 
tance of the undertaking was made manifest by the giving of the 
revelation herein appearing as Section 1, which is currently known as 
the Preface. 9 

During the conference at Hiram, the Elders present testified in- 
dividually to their conviction of the Divine origin of the revelations, 
and of their willingness to proclaim their testimony to the world. 
Their solemn affirmation was thereupon formulated as follows:

Church, vol. 1, page 5. b, see P. of G. P., Writings of Joseph Smith 2:27 — 60, 
and History of the Church, vol. 1, chaps. 1 — 8. c, see especially 1:6.

THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES to the Book of 
the Lord's Commandments, which He gave to His Church through 
Joseph Smith, Jun., who was appointed by the voice of the Church 
for this purpose: 

We, therefore, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world 
of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth and 
upon the islands of the sea, that the Lord has borne record to our 
souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these com- 
mandments were given by inspiration of God, and are profitable 
for all men, and are verily true. 

We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our 
helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father, and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of 
bearing this testimony unto the world, that the children of men 
may be profited thereby.* 

Two days after the conference at Hiram, the revelation herein ap- 
pearing as Section 133 was received. This was added to the compila- 
tion, and called the Appendix. In connection with the record of this 
addition, the title Doctrine and Covenants first appears as the name 
of the book. Prior to that time, the manuscript compilation was fre- 
quently referred to in the historical records as the Book of Command- 
ments, and Covenants and Commandments. 

In accordance with official action taken at the conference of the 
Church, the manuscript was sent to Independence, Missouri, then 
known as Zion, in care of Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer." In 
due course the printing was begun, and by the early summer of 1833 
was nearing completion. But on July 20, 1833, the printing plant at 
Independence, together with most of its contents, including all save 
a few copies of some of the forms of the unfinished book, was destroyed 
by a mob. 

Notwithstanding this calamity, the Church was undaunted in the 
mission laid upon it to publish the latter-day revelations of God to 
mankind. On September 24, 1834, at a meeting of the High Council 
in Kirtland, Ohio, a committee, with Joseph Smith, the Prophet and 
President of the Church, at its head, was constituted to publish the 
revelations and other matter relating to the doctrines of the Church. 
This committee reported the completion of its labors to a General 
Assembly of the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835. The 
congregation was seated in the order of solemn assembly — each quorum

or distinctive body of the Priesthood being in its place — and the accep- 
tance of the revelations contained in the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants was expressed by the separate vote of each quorum, and then 
by the united vote of the entire assembly. 

The testimony of the Twelve Apostles of the Church was formulated, 
signed and presented to the assembly in the form following : f 

TESTIMONY OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES TO THE TRUTH 
OF THE BOOK OF DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS. 

The Testimony of the Witnesses to the Book of the Lord's Com- 
mandments, which commandments He gave to His Church through 
Joseph Smith, Jun., who was appointed by the voice of the Church 
for this purpose : 

We, therefore, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world 
of mankind, to every creature upon the face of all the earth, that 
the Lord has borne record to our souls, through the Holy Ghost 
shed forth upon us, that these commandments were given by in- 
spiration of God, and are profitable for all men and are verily 
true. 

We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our 
helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father, and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of 
bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice 
exceedingly, praying the Lord always that the children of men 
may be profited thereby.

In successive editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, additional 
revelations or other matters of record have been added, as received, 
and as accepted by competent assemblies or conferences of the Church. 

Certain lessons, entitled "Lectures on Faith," which were bound 
in with the Doctrine and Covenants in some of its former issues, are 
not included in this edition. Those lessons were prepared for use in 
the School of the Elders, conducted in Kirtland, Ohio, during the 
winter of 1834-1835; but they were never presented to nor accepted 
by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons.

THE 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 



SECTION 1. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, during a 
special conference of Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, held at Hiram, Ohio, November 1, 1831. Many revela- 
tions had been received from the Lord prior to this time; and the 
compilation of these for publication in book form was one of the 
principal subjects passed upon at the conference. See History of 
the Church, vol. 1, page 222. This Section constitutes the Lord's 
Preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this 

dispensation. Proclamation of warning and commandment to the 

Church and to. the inhabitants of the earth at large — The authority of 
the Priesthood in this dispensation attested — Second advent of the 
Lord Jesus Christ foretold — Authenticity of the Book of Mormon 
affirmed. 

1. Hearken, O ye people of a my 
church, saith the voice of him 
who dwells on high, and whose 
eyes are upon all men ; yea, verily 
I say: Hearken ye people from 
afar; and ye that are upon the 
islands of the sea, listen together. 

2. For verily the voice of the 
Lord Is unto *all men, and there 
is none to escape ; and there is no 
eye that shall not see, neither ear 
that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not he penetrated. 

3. And the rebellious shall be 
pierced with much sorrow; for 
their iniquities shall be spoken 
upon the housetops, and their 
secret acts shall be revealed. 



4. And the voice of warning 
shall be unto all people, by the 
mouths of my disciples, whom I 
have chosen in these last days. 

5. And they shall go forth and 
none shall stay them, for I the 
Lord have commanded them. 

6. Behold, this is mine author- 
ity, and the Authority of my ser- 
vants, and my preface unto* the 
book of my commandments, which 
I have given them to publish 
unto you, O inhabitants of the 
earth. 

7. Wherefore, fear and tremble, 
O ye people, for what I the Lord 
have decreed in them shall be 
fulfilled.

8. And verily 1 say unto you, 
that they who go forth, bearing 
these tidings unto the inhabitants 
of the earth, to them is power 
given to 'seal both on earth and 
In heaven, the unbelieving and 
rebellious; 

9. Yea, verily, to seal them up 
unto the day when the wrath of 
God shall be poured out upon the 
wicked" without measure — 

10. Unto the day when the 
Lord shall come to recompense 
unto every man according to his 
work, and measure to every man 
according to the measure which 
he has measured to his fellow 
man. 

11. Wherefore the voice of the 
Lord is unto the ends of the earth, 
that all that will hear may hear: 

12. Prepare ye, prepare ye for 
that which is to come, for the 
Lord Is 'nigh; 

13. And the anger of the Lord 
Ib kindled, and his sword is 
'bathed in heaven, and it shall 
lall upon the inhabitants of the 

14. And the arm of the Lord 
shall be revealed; and the day 
cometh that they who wilt not 
hear the voice of the Lord, neither 
the voice of his servants, neither 
give heed to the words of the 
prophets and apostles, shall be 
'cut off from among the people; 

15. For they have atrayed from 



mine ordinances, and have "bro- 
ken mine everlasting covenant; 

16. They seek not the Lord to 
establish his righteousness, hut 
every man walketh in his own 
way, and after the Image of his 
own God, whose image is in the 
likeness of the world, and whose 
substance is that of an idol, which 
waxeth old and shall perish in 
Babylon, even Babylon the great, 
'which shall fall. 

17. Wherefore, I the Lord, 
knowing the calamity which 
should come upon the inhabitants 
of the earth, called upon my ser- 
vant Joseph Smith, Jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and 
gave him commandments; 

IS. And also gave command- 
ments to others, that they, should 
proclaim these things unto the 
world; and all this that it might 
be fulfilled, which was written by 
the prophets — 

19. The 'weak things of the 
world shall come forth and break 
down the mighty and strong ones, 
that man should not counsel his 
fellow man, neither trust in the 
arm of flesh— 

20. But that every man might 
speak in the name of God the 
Lord, even the Savior of the 

31. 'That faith also might in- 
crease In the earth;

enant might he established;

23. That the fulness of my gos- 
pel might be proclaimed by the 
weak and the simple unto the 
ends of the world, and before 
kings and rulers. 

24. Behold, I am God and have 
spoken it; these commandments 
are of me, and were given unto 
my servants in their weakness, 
after the manner of their lan- 
guage, that they might come to 
understanding. 

25. And inasmuch as they erred 
it might be made known; 

26. And inasmuch as they 
sought wisdom they might be in- 
structed ; 

27. And inasmuch as they 
sinned they might be chastened, 
that they might repent; 

28. And inasmuch as they were 
humble they might be made 
strong, and blessed from on high, 
and receive knowledge from time 
to time. 

29. And after having received 
the record of the Nephites, yea, 
even my servant Joseph Smith; 
Jun., might have power to trans- 
late through the mercy of God, 
by the power of God, the Book of 
Mormon. 

30. And also those to whom 
these commandments were given, 
might have 'power to lay the 
foundation of this church, and to 
bring it m forth out of obscurity 
and out of darkness, the only true 
and living church upon the face 
of the whole earth, with which I, 
the Lord, am well pleased, speak- 
ing unto the church collectively 
and not fndividually — * 

31. For I the Lord cannot look 
upon sin with the least degree of 
allowance; 



32. Nevertheless, he that re- 
pents and does the command- 
ments of the Lord shall be for- 
given ; 

33. And he that repents not, 
from him shall be taken even the 
light which he has received; for 
my Spirit shall not always strive 
with man, saith the Lord of 
Hosts. 

34. And again, verily I say 
unto you, O inhabitants of the 
earth: I the Lord am willing to 
make these things known unto 
"all flesh; 

35. For I am no respecter of 
persons, and will that all men 
shall know that the day speedily 
cometh; the hour is not yet, but 
is nigh at hand, when "peace 
shall be taken from the earth, 
and the "devil shall have power 
over his own dominion. 

36. And also the Lord shall 
have power over his saints, and 
shall reign in their midst, and 
shall come down in judgment 
upon «Idumea, or the world. 

37. Search these command- 
ments, for they are true and 
faithful, and the prophecies and 
promises which are in them shall 
all be fulfilled. 

38. What I the Lord have 
spoken, I have spoken, and I ex- 
cuse not myself; and though the 
heavens and the earth pass away, 
my word shall not pass away, but 
shall all be fulfilled, whether by 
mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same. 

39. For behold, and lo, the 
Lord is God, and the Spirit bear- 
eth record, and the record is true, 
and the truth abideth forever and 
ever. Amen.

SECTION 2. 

Words spoken by Moroni, the Angel, to Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
while in his father's house at Manchester, New York, on the evening 
of September 21, 1823. See History of the Church, vol. 1, page 12. 
Moroni was the last of a long line of historians who had made the 
record that is now before the world as the Book of Mormon. Compare 
Malachi 4:5, 6. See also Sections 27:9 and 110:13-16. 



1. Behold, I will reveal unto 
you the Priesthood, by the hand 
of "Elijah the prophet, before the 
•coming of the great and dread- 
ful day of the Lord. 

2. And he shall plant in the 
hearts of the children the prom- 



ises made to the fathers, and the 
hearts of the children c shall turn 
to their fathers. 

3. If it were not so, the whole 
earth would be utterly wasted at 
his coming. 



SECTION 3. 



Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, 
Pennsylvania, July, 1828, relating to the loss of certain manuscripts 
of the first part of the Book of Mormon, which Joseph had reluctantly 
allowed to pass from his custody to that of Martin Harris, who had 
served for a brief period as scribe in the translation of the Book of 
Mormon. This revelation was given through the TJrim and Thummim. 
See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 21. Compare Section 10. 



1. The works, and the designs, 
and the purposes of God cannot 
be frustrated, neither can they 
come to naught. 

2. For God doth not walk in 
crooked paths, neither doth he 
turn to the right hand nor to the 
left, neither doth he vary from 
that which he hath said, there- 
fore his paths are straight, and 
his course is a one eternal round. 

3. Remember, remember that 
it is not the work of God that is 
frustrated, but the work of men; 

4. For although a man may 
have many revelations, and have 
power to do many mighty works, 
yet if he boasts in his own 
strength, and sets at naught the 



counsels of God, and follows after 
the dictates of his own will and 
carnal desires, he must fall and 
incur the vengeance of a just 
God upon him. 

5. Behold, you have been en- 
trusted with these things, but 
how strict were your command- 
ments; and remember also the 
promises which were made to 
you, if you did not transgress 
them. 

6. And behold, how oft you 
have transgressed the command- 
ments and the laws of God, and 
have gone on in the persuasions 
of men. 

7. For, behold, you should not 
have feared man more than God.

DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 3. 



Although men set at naught the 
counsels of God, and despise his 
words— 

8. Yet you should have been 
faithful; and he would have ex- 
tended his arm and supported you 
against all the fiery darts of the 
adversary; and he would have 
been with you in every time of 
trouble. 

9. Behold, thou art Joseph, 
and thou wast chosen to do the 
-work of the Lord, but because 
of transgression, if thou art not 
aware thou wilt fall. 

10. But remember, God is mer- 
ciful; therefore, repent of that 
which thou hast done which is 
contrary to the commandment 
which I gave you, and thou art 
still chosen, and art again called 
to the work; 

11. Except thou do this, thou 
shalt be delivered up and become 
as other men, and have no more 
gift. 

12. And when thou deliveredst 
up that which God had given thee 
'sight and power to translate, 
thou deliveredst up that which 
was sacred into the hands of a 
wicked man, 

13. Who has set at naught the 
counsels of God, and has broken 
the most sacred promises which 
were made before God, and has 
depended upon his own judgment 
and boasted in his own wisdom. 

14. And this is the reason that 
thou hast lost thy privileges for 
a season — 



15. For thou hast suffered the 
counsel of thy director to be 
trampled upon from the begin- 
ning. 

16. Nevertheless, my work 
shall go forth, for inasmuch as 
the knowledge of a Savior has 
come unto the world, through the 
'testimony of the Jews, even so 
shall the knowledge of a Savior 
come unto my people — 

17. And to the "Nephites, and 
the Jacobites, and the Josephites, 
and the Zoramites, through the 
testimony of their fathers — 

18. And this testimony shall 
come to the knowledge of the 
"Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, 
and the Ishmaelites, who dwin- 
dled in unbelief because of the 
iniquity of their fathers, whom 
the Lord has suffered to 'destroy 
their brethren the Nephites, be- 
cause of their iniquities and their 
abominations. 

19. And for this very purpose 
are these plates preserved, which 
contain these records — : that the 
promises of the Lord might be 
fulfilled, which he made to his 
people; 

20. And that the Lamanites 
might come to the 'knowledge of 
their fathers, and that they might 
know the promisea of the Lord, 
and that they may believe the 
gospel and rely upon the merits 
of Jesus Christ, and be glorified 
through faith in his name, and 
that through "their repentance 
they might be saved. Amen.

DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 4, 5. 

SECTION 4. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to his father, 

Joseph Smith, Sen., at Harmony, Pennsylvania, February, 1829. 

Qualifications for the labors of the ministry are set forth. 



1. Now behold, a "marvelous 
work is about to come forth 
among the children of men. 

2. Therefore, O ye that em- 
bark in the service of God, see 
that ye serve him with all your 
heart, might, mind and strength, 
that ye may stand blameless be- 
fore God at the last day. 

3. Therefore, if ye have desires 
to serve God ye are called to the 
work; 

4. For behold the field is *white 
already to harvest; and lo, he 
that thrusteth in his sickle with 



his might, the same layeth up in 
store that he perisheth not, but 
bringeth salvation to his soul; 

5. And faith, hope, charity and 
love, with an eye single to the 
glory of God, qualify him for the 
work. 

6. Remember faith, virtue, 
knowledge, temperance, patience, 
brotherly kindness, godliness, 
charity, humility, diligence. 

7. c Ask, and ye shall receive; 
knock, and it shall be opened unto 
you. Amen. 



SECTION 5. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, 
Pennsylvania, March, 1829. Three witnesses to the Book of Mor- 
mon are promised, of whom Martin Harris is to be one if he shall 
prove himself worthy — Baptism is foreshadowed, but as no one had 
at this time been ordained to administer the ordinance, patient waiting 
is enjoined — Note that ordination followed, a few weeks later; see 
Section 13. 



1. Behold, I say unto you, that 
as my servant Martin Harris has 
desired a witness at my hand, 
that you, my servant Joseph Smith, 
Jun., have got the plates of which 
you have testified and borne rec- 
ord that you have received of me ; 

2. And now, behold, this shall 
you say unto him — he who spake 
unto you, said unto you: I, the 
Lord, am God, and have given 
these things unto you, my ser- 
vant Joseph Smith, Jun., and 






have commanded you that you 
should stand as a witness of these 
things; 

3. And I have caused you that 
you should enter into a covenant 
with me, that you should not 
show them except to those "per- 
sons to whom I commanded you; 
and you have no power over them 
except I grant it unto you. 

4. And you have a *gift to 
translate the plates; and this is 
the first gift that I bestowed upon

you; and I have commanded that 
you should pretend to no other 
gilt until my purpose la fulfilled 
In this; for I will grant unto you 
no other gift until it 1b finished. 
6. Verily, 1 say unto you, that 
c woe shall come unto the inhabi- 
tants of the earth If they will not 
hearken unto my words; 

6. For hereafter you shall be 
'ordained and go forth and de- 
liver my words unto the children 
of men. 

7. Behold, if they will not be- 
lieve my words, they would not 
believe you, my servant Joseph, 
If it were possible that you should 
show them all these things which 
I have committed unto you. 

8. Oh, this unbelieving and 
Btftfnecked generation — mine an- 
ger is kindled against them. 

9. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, I have reserved those things 
which I have entrusted unto you, 
my servant Joseph, for a wise 
purpose in me, and it shall be 
made known unto future genera- 
tions; 

10. But this generation shall 
have my word 'through you; 

11. And In Addition to your 
testimony, the 'testimony of three 
of my servants, whom I shall call 
and ordain, unto whom I will 
show these things, and they shall 
go forth with my words that are 
given through you. 

12. Yea, they shall know of a 
surety that these things are true, 
for from heaven will I declare it 
unto them. 

13. I will give them power that 



they may behold and view these 
things as they are; 

14. And to none else will I 
grant this power, to receive this 
'same testimony among this gen- 
eration, in this the beginning of 
the rising up and the coming 
forth of 'my church out of the 
wilderness — 'clear as the moon, 
and fair as the sun, and terrible 
as an army with banners. 

15. And the testimony of three 
witnesses will I send forth of my 

16. And behold, whosoever be- 
Ileveth on my words, them will I 
'visit with the manifestation of 
my Spirit; and they shall be 
"born of me, even of 'water and 
of the "Spirit — 

17. And you must wait yet a 
little while, for ye are not yet 
ordained — 

18. And their testimony shall 
"also go forth unto the condem- 
nation of this generation If they 
harden their hearts against them; 

19. For a "desolating scourge 
shall go forth among the Inhabi- 
tants of the earth, and shall con- 
tinue to be poured out from time 
to time, if they repent not, until 
the earth Is empty, and the In- 
habitants thereof are consumed 
away and utterly destroyed by 
the "brightness of my coming. 

20. Behold, I tell you these 
things, even as I also told the 
people of the destruction of Jeru- 
salem; and my word shall be 
■verified at this time as it hath 
hitherto been verified. 

21. And now I command you.

my servant Joseph, to repent and 
walk more uprightly before me, 
and to yield to the persuasions of 
men no more; 

22. And that you be firm 
in keeping the commandments 
wherewith I have commanded 
you; and if you do this, behold 
I grant unto you eternal life, 
'even if you should be slain. 

23. And now, again, I speak 
unto you, my servant Joseph, con- 
cerning the 'man that desires the 
witness — 

24. Behold, I say unto him, he 
exalts himself and does not hum- 
ble himself sufficiently before me; 
but if he will bow down before 
me, and humble himself in mighty 
prayer and faith, in the sincerity 
of his heart, then will I grant 
unto him a 'view of the things 
which he desires to see. 

25. And then he shall say unto 
the people of this generation: 
Behold, I have seen the things 
which the Lord hath shown unto 
Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know 
of a surety that they are true, for 
I have seen them, for they have 
been shown unto me by the power 
of God and not of man. 

26. And I the Lord command 
him, my servant Martin Harris, 
that he shall say no more unto 
them concerning these things, ex- 
cept he shall say: I have seen 
them, and they have been shown 
unto me by the power of God; 
and these are the words which he 
shall say. 

27. But if he deny this he will 
break the covenant which he has 
before covenanted with me, and 
behold, he is condemned. 

28. And now, except he humble 
himself and acknowledge unto me 
the things that he has done which 



are wrong, and covenant with me 
that he will keep my command- 
ments, and exercise faith in me, 
behold, I say unto him, he shall 
have no such views, for I will 
grant unto him no views of the 
things of which I have spoken. 

29. And if this be the case, I 
command you, my servant Joseph, 
that you shall say unto him, that 
he shall do no more, nor trouble 
me any more concerning this 
matter. 

30. And if this be the case, be- 
hold, I say unto thee Joseph, 
when thou hast translated a few 
more pages thou shalt stop for a 
season, even until I command 
thee again; then thou mayest 
translate again. 

31. And except thou do this, 
behold, thou shalt have no more 
gift, and I will take away the 
things which I have entrusted 
with thee. 

32. And now, because I fore- 
see the lying in wait to destroy 
thee, yea, I foresee that if my 
servant Martin Harris humbleth 
not himself and receive a witness 
from my hand, that he will fall 
into transgression; 

33. And there are many that 
lie in wait to destroy thee from 
off the face of the earth; and for 
this cause, that thy days may be 
prolonged, I have given unto thee 
these commandments. 

34. Yea, for this cause I have 
said: Stop, and stand still until 
I command thee, and I will pro- 
vide means whereby thou mayest 
accomplish the thing which I have 
commanded thee. 

35. And if thou art faithful in 
keeping my commandments, thou 
shalt be "lifted up at the last 
day. Amen.

SECTION 6. 

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Oliver Cow- 
iery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April, 1829. Oliver Cowdery began 
his labors as scribe, in the translation of the Book of Mormon, April 7, 
1829. He had already received a divine manifestation attesting the 
truth of Joseph's testimony respecting the plates on which was en- 
graved the Book of Mormon record. Joseph inquired of the Lord 
through the Urim and Thummim and received this response. See His- 

tory of the Church, vol. 1, pp. 32-35. Oliver's willingness to serve 

is commended; and both to him and to Joseph blessings of great import 
are promised. 



1 . A great and "marvelous work 
Ls about to come forth unto the 
children of men. 

2. Behold, I am God; give heed 
unto my word, which is quick and 
powerful, sharper than • a two- 
edged sword, to the dividing 
asunder of both joints and mar- 
row ; therefore give heed unto my 
words. 

3. Behold, the field is "white 
already to harvest; therefore, 
whoso desireth to reap, let him 
thrust in his sickle with his 
might, and reap while the day 
lasts, that he may treasure up 
for his soul everlasting salvation 
in the kingdom of God. 

4. Yea, whosoever will thrust 
in his sickle and reap, the c same 
is called of God. 

5. Therefore, if you will d ask 
of me you shall receive; if you 
will knock it shall be opened unto 
you. 

6. Now, as you have asked, be- 
hold, I say unto you, keep my 
commandments, and seek to 
'bring forth and establish the 
cause of Zion; 

7. Seek not for riches but for 
wisdom, and behold, the mys- 
teries of God shall be unfolded 
unto you, and then shall you be 
made rich. Behold, he that hath 
eternal life is rich. 



8. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, even as you desire of me so 
it shall be unto you; and if you 
desire, you shall be the means of 
doing much good in this genera- 
tion. 

9. Say nothing but repentance 
unto this generation; keep my 
commandments, and assist to 
bring forth my work, according 
to my commandments, and you 
shall be blessed. 

10. Behold thou hast a gift, 
and blessed art thou because of 
thy gift. Remember it is sacred 
and cometh from above — 

11. And if thou wilt inquire, 
thou shalt know mysteries which 
are great and marvelous; there- 
fore thou shalt exercise thy gift, 
that thou mayest find out mys- 
teries, that thou mayest bring 
many to the knowledge of the 
truth, yea, convince them of the 
error of their ways. 

12. Make not thy gift known 
unto any save it be those who 
are of thy faith. Trifle not with 
sacred things. 

13. If thou wilt do good, yea, 
and hold out faithful to the end, 
thou shalt be saved in the king- 
dom of God, which is the 'greatest 
of all the gifts of God; for there 
is no gift greater than the gift of 
salvation.

14. Verily, verily, I say unto 
thee, blessed art thou for what 
thou hast done; for thou hast in- 
quired of me, and behold, as often 
as thou hast inquired thou hast 
received instruction of my Spirit. 
If it had not been so, thou wouldst 
not have come to the place where 
thou art at this time. 

15. Behold, thou knowest that 
thou hast inquired of me and I 
did enlighten thy mind; and now 
I tell thee these things that thou 
mayest know that thou hast been 
enlightened by the Spirit of truth ; 

16. Yea, I tell thee, that thou 
mayest know that there is none 
else save God that knowest thy 
thoughts and the intents of thy 
heart. 

17. I tell thee these things as 
a witness unto thee — that the 
words or the work which thou 
hast been writing are true. 

18. Therefore be diligent; 
stand by my servant Joseph, faith- 
fully, in whatsoever difficult cir- 
cumstances he may be for the 
word's sake. 

19. Admonish him in his faults, 
and also receive admonition of 
him. Be patient; be sober; be 
temperate; have patience, faith, 
hope and charity. 

20. Behold, thou art Oliver, 
and I have spoken unto thee be- 
cause of thy desires; therefore 
treasure up these words in thy 
heart. Be faithful and diligent 
in keeping the commandments of 
God, and I will encircle thee in 
the arms of my love. 

21. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, 
the Son of God. I am the same 
that came unto 'mine own, and 
mine own received me not. I am 



the light which *shineth in dark- 
ness, and the darkness compre- 
hendeth it not. 

22. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, if you desire a further wit- 
ness, cast your mind upon the 
night that you cried unto me in 
your heart, that you might know 
concerning the truth of these 
things. 

23. Did I not speak peace to 
your mind concerning the mat- 
ter? What greater witness can 
you have than from God? 

24. And now, behold, you have 
received a witness; for if I have 
told you things which no man 
knoweth have you not received a 
witness?. 

25. And, behold, I grant unto 
you a gift, if you desire of me, 
to * translate, even as my servant 
Joseph. , 

26. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, that 'there are records which 
contain much of my gospel, which 
have been kept back because of 
the wickedness of the people; 

27. And now I command you, 
that if you have good desires — a 
desire to lay up treasures for 
yourself in heaven — then shall 
you assist in bringing to light, 
with your gift, those parts of my 
scriptures which have been hid- 
den because of iniquity. 

28. And now, behold, I give 
unto you, and also unto my ser- 
vant Joseph, the *keys of this gift, 
which shall bring to light this 
ministry; and in the mouth of 
*two or three witnesses shall 
every word be established. 

29. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, if they reject my words, and

30. And even if they do unto

me, blessed are ye, for you shall

words, which shall be established 
by the testimony which shall be 
given, blessed are they, and then 
shall ye have joy in the fruit of 
your labors.

"where two or three are gathered 
together in my name, as touching 
one thing, behold, there will I be 
in the midst of them — even so am 
I in the midst of you. 

33. Fear not to do good, my 
sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that 



shall ye also reap; therefore, if 
ye sow good ye shall also reap 
good for your reward. 

34. Therefore, fear not, little 
flock; do good; let earth and hell 
combine against you, for if ye 
are built upon °my rock, they 
cannot prevail. 

35. Behold, I do not condemn 
you; go your ways and sin no 
more; perform with soberness the 
work which I have commanded 
you. 

36. Look unto me in every 
thought; doubt not, fear not. 

37. Behold the wounds which 
pierced my side, and also the 
prints of the nails in my hands 
and feet; be faithful, keep my 
commandments, and ye shall in- 
herit the kingdom of heaven. 
Amen.

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Oliver Cow- 
dery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April, 1829, when they inquired 
through the XI rim and Thummim as to whether John, the beloved 
disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The revelation is the trans- 
lated version of the record made on parchment by John and hidden 
up by himself. See History of the Church, vol. 1, pp. 35, 36. 



1. And the Lord said unto me: 
John, my beloved, what desirest 
thou? For if you shall ask what 
you will, it shall be granted unto 
you. 

2. And I said unto him: Lord, 
give unto me power over death, 
that I may live and bring souls 
unto thee. 

3. And the Lord said unto me: 
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
because thou desirest this thou 
shalt "tarry until I come in my 
glory, and shalt prophesy before 
nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people. 



4. And for this cause the Lord 
said unto Peter: "If I will that he 
tarry till I come, what is that to 
thee? For he desired of me that 
he might bring souls unto me, 
but thou desiredst that thou 
mightest speedily come unto me 
in my kingdom. 

5. I say unto thee, Peter, this 
was a good desire; but my be- 
loved has desired that he might 
do more, or a greater work yet 
among men than what he has 
before done. 

6. Yea, he has undertaken a 
greater work; therefore I will

of salvation who dwell on the 
earth. 

7. And I will make thee to 
minister for him and for thy 
brother James; and unto you 



three I will give this power and 
the d keys of this ministry until I 
come.

desires, for ye both joy in that

SECTION 8. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Oliver 
Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April, 1829. In the course of 
the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who continued to 
serve as scribe, writing at the prophet's dictation, desired to be en~ 
dowed with the gift of translation. The Lord responded to his sup- 
plication by granting this revelation. The spirit of revelation 

is defined, and the gift of Aaron specified. 



1. Oliver Cowdery, verily, ver- 
ily, I say unto you, that as- 
suredly as the Lord liveth, who 
is your God and your Redeemer, 
even so surely shall you receive 
a knowledge of whatsoever things 
you shall ask in faith, with an 
honest heart, believing that you 
shall receive a knowledge con- 
cerning the engravings of °old 
records, which are ancient, which 
contain those parts of my scrip- 
ture of which has been spoken 
by the manifestation of my Spirit. 

2. Yea, behold, I will tell you 
in your mind and in your heart, 
by the Holy Ghost, which shall 
come upon you and which shall 
dwell in your heart. 

3. Now, behold, this is the 
spirit of revelation; behold, this 
is the spirit by which Moses 
brought the children of Israel 
through the Red Sea on dry 
ground. 

4. Therefore this is thy gift; 
apply unto it, and blessed art 
thou, for it shall deliver you out 
of the hands of your enemies, 



when, if it were not so, they 
would slay you and bring your 
soul to destruction. 

5. Oh, remember these words, 
and keep my commandments. 
Remember, this is your gift. 

6. Now this is not all thy gift; 
for you have another gift, which 
is the 6 gift of Aaron; behold, it 
has told you many things; 

7. Behold, there is no other 
power, save the power of God, 
that can cause this gift of Aaron 
to be with you. 

8. Therefore, doubt not, for it 
is the gift of God; and you shall 
hold it in your hands, and do 
marvelous works; and no power 
shall be able to take it away out 
of your hands, for it is the work 
of God. 

9. And, therefore, whatsoever 
you shall ask me to tell you by 
that means, that will I grant unto 
you, and you shall have knowl- 
edge concerning it. 

10. Remember that without 
faith you can do nothing; there- 
fore ask in faith. Trifle not with

these things; do not ask for that 
which you ought not. 

11. Ask that you may know 
the mysteries of God, and that 
e you may translate and receive 
knowledge from all those ancient 
records which have been hid up, 



that are sacred ; and according to 
your faith shall it be done unto 
you. 

12. Behold, it is I that have 
spoken it; and I am the same 
that spake unto you from the be- 
ginning. Amen. 



SECTION 9. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Oliver 
Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April, 1829. Oliver is admon- 
ished to patience, and is urged to be content to write, for the time 
being, at the dictation of the translator, rather than to attempt to 

translate. It is not sufficient for one merely to ask for a divine 

gift, without prayerful thought and study — Oliver loses such small 
measure of the gift of translation as he had temporarily possessed. 

would give it unto you, when you 
took no thought save it was to 
ask me. 

8. But, behold, I say unto you, 
that you must study it out in your 
mind; then you must ask me if 
it be right, and if it is right I 
will cause that your bosom shall 
burn within you; therefore, you 
shall feel that it is right. 

9. But if it be not right you 
shall have no such feelings, but 
you shall have a stupor of thought 
that shall cause you to forget the 
thing which is wrong; therefore, 
you cannot write that which is 
sacred save it be given you from 
me. 

10. Now, if you had known 
this you could have "translated; 
nevertheless, it is not expedient 
that you should translate now. 

11. Behold, it was expedient 
when you commenced; but you 
feared, and the time is past, and 
it is not expedient now; 

12. For, do you not behold that 
I have given unto my servant 
Joseph sufficient strength, where- 
by it is made up? And neither 
of you have I condemned. 



1. Behold, I say unto you, my 
son, that because you did not 
translate according to that which 
you desired of me, and did com- 
mence again to write for my ser- 
vant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so 
I would that ye should continue 
until you have finished this rec- 
ord, which I have entrusted unto 
him. 

2. And then, behold, other rec- 
ords have I, that I will give unto 
you power that you may .assist to 
translate. 

3. Be patient, my son, for it is 
wisdom in me, and it is not ex- 
pedient that you should translate 
at this present time. 

4. Behold, the work which you 
are called to do is to write for 
my servant Joseph. 

5. And, behold, it is because 
that you did not continue as you 
commenced, when you began to 
translate, that I have taken away 
this privilege from you. 

6. Do not murmur, my son, for 
it is wisdom in me that I have 
dealt with you after this manner. 

7. Behold, you have not under- 
stood; you have supposed that I

13. Do this thing which I have 
commanded you, and you shall 
prosper. Be faithful, and yield 
to no temptation. 

14. Stand fast in the work 



wherewith I have called you, and 
a hair of your head shall not be 
lost, and you shall he "lifted up 
at the last day. Amen. 



SECTION 10. 



Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, 

Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1828, Herein the Lord informs 

Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in the 116 manuscript 
pages of the Book of Mormon, which had been lost from the possession 
of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. 
Compare Section 3. See History of the Church, vol. 1, pp. 21, 23. 
The evil design was to await the expected re-translation of the matter 
covered by the stolen pages, and then to discredit the translator by 
showing the discrepancies created by the alterations. That this wicked 
purpose had been conceived by the evil one, and was known to the 
Lord even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making 
his abridgment of the accumulated plates is shown in the Book of 
Mormon. See The Words of Mormon 3-7. 

vants of Satan that do uphold his 
work. 

6. Behold, they have sought to 
destroy you; yea, even the man 
in whom you have trusted has 
sought to destroy you. 

7. And for this cause I said 
that he is a wicked man, for he 
has sought to take away the 
things wherewith you have been 
entrusted; and he has also sought 
to destroy your gift. 

8. And because you have de- 
livered the writings into his 
hands, behold, wicked men have 
taken them from you. 

9. Therefore, you have de- 
livered them up, yea, that which 
was sacred, unto wickedness. 

10. And, behold, Satan hath 
put it into their hearts to alter 
the words which you have caused 
to be written, or which you have 
translated, which have gone out 
of your hands. 

11. And behold, I say unto 



1. Now, behold, I say unto you, 
that because you delivered up 
those writings which you had 
power given unto you to trans- 
late by the means of the Urim 
and Thummim, into the hands of 
a wicked man, you have "lost 
them. 

2. And you also lost your gift 
at the same time, and your mind 
became darkened. 

3. Nevertheless, it is now re- 
stored unto you again; therefore 
see that you are faithful and con- 
tinue on unto the finishing of the 
remainder of the work of trans- 
lation as you have begun. 

4. Do not run faster or labor 
more than you have strength and 
means provided to enable you to 
translate; but be diligent unto 
the end. 

5. Pray always, that you may 
come off conqueror; yea, that you 
may conquer Satan, and that you 
may escape the hands of the ser-

16 



you, that because they have al- 
tered the words, they read con- 
trary from that which you trans- 
lated and caused to be written; 

12. And, on this wise, the 
devil has sought to lay a cunning 
plan, that he may destroy this 
work; 

13. For he hath put into their 
hearts to do this, that by lying 
they may say they have caught 
you in the words which you have 
pretended to translate. 

14. Verily, I say unto you, that 
I will not suffer that Satan shall 
accomplish his evil design in this 
thing. 

15. For behold, he has put it 
into their hearts to get thee to 
tempt the Lord thy God, in ask- 
ing to translate it over again. 

16. And then, behold, they say 
and think in their hearts — We 
will see if God has given him 
power to translate; if so, he will 
also give him power again; 

17. And if God giveth him 
power again, or if he translates 
again, or, in other words, if he 
bringeth forth the same words, 
behold, we have the same with 
us, and we have altered them; 

18. Therefore they will not 
agree, and we will say that he 
has lied in his words, and that 
he has no gift, and that he has 
no power; 

19. Therefore we will destroy 
him, and also the work; and we 
will do this that we may not be 
ashamed in the end, and that we 
may get glory of the world. 

20. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, that Satan has great hold 
upon their hearts; he stirreth 
them up to iniquity against that 
which is good; 

21. And their hearts are cor- 
rupt, and full of wickedness and 
abominations; and they love 



darkness rather than light, be- 
cause their deeds are evil; there- 
fore they will not ask of me. 

22. Satan stirreth them up, 
that he may lead their souls to 
destruction. 

23. And thus he has laid a 
'cunning plan, thinking to de- 
stroy the work of God; but I 
will require this at their hands, 
and it shall turn to their shame 
and condemnation in the day of 
judgment. 

24. Yea, he stirreth up their 
hearts to anger against this work. 

25. Yea, he saith unto them: 
Deceive and lie in wait to catch, 
that ye may destroy ; behold, this 
is no harm. And thus he flat- 
tereth them, and telleth them 
that it is no sin to lie that they 
may catch a man in a lie, that 
they may destroy him. 

26. And thus he flattereth 
them, and leadeth them along 
until he draggeth their souls 
down to hell; and thus he causeth 
them to catch themselves in their 
own snare. 

27. And thus he goeth up and 
down, to and fro in the earth, 
seeking to destroy the souls of 
men. 

28. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, wo be unto him that lieth 
to deceive because he supposeth 
that another lieth to deceive, for 
such are not exempt from the jus- 
tice of God. 

29. Now, behold, they have al- 
tered these words, because Satan 
saith unto them: He hath de- 
ceived you — and thus he flat- 
tereth them away to do iniquity, 
to get thee to tempt the Lord thy 
God. 

30. Behold, I say unto you, 
that you shall not translate again 
those words which have gone 
forth out of your hands; 



«, 2 Ne. 28:19—23. 



16 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 10. 



31. For, behold, they shall not 
accomplish their evil designs in 
lying against those words. For, 
behold, if you should bring forth 
the same words they will say 
that you have lied and that you 
have pretended to translate, but 
that you have contradicted your- 
self. 

32. And, behold, they will pub- 
lish this, and Satan will harden 
the hearts of the people to stir 
them up to anger against you, 
that they will not believe my 
words. 

33. Thus Satan thinketh to 
overpower your testimony in this 
generation, that the work may 
not come forth in this generation. 

34. But behold, here is wisdom, 
and because I show unto you wis- 
dom, and give .you command- 
ments concerning these things, 
what you shall do, show it not 
unto the world until you have ac- 
complished the work of transla- 
tion. 

35. Marvel not that I said unto 
you: Here is wisdom, show it not 
unto the world — for I said, show 
it not unto the world, that you 
may be preserved. 

36. Behold, I do not say that 
you shall not show it unto the 
righteous; 

37. But as you cannot always 
judge the righteous, or as you 
cannot always tell the wicked 
from the righteous, therefore I 
say unto you, hold your peace 
until I shall see fit to make all 
things known unto the world con- 
cerning the matter. 

38. And now, verily I say unto 
you, that an account of those 
things that you have written, 
which have gone out of your 
hands, is engraven upon the 
plates of Nephi; 

39. Yea, and you remember it 



was said in those writings that 
a more particular account was 
given of these things upon the 
plates of Nephi. 

40. And now, because the ac- 
count which is engraven upon the 
plates of Nephi is more particular 
concerning the things which, in 
my wisdom, I would bring to the 
knowledge of the people in this 
account — 

41. Therefore, you shall trans- 
late the engravings which are on 
the 6 plates of Nephi, down even 
till you come to the reign of 
king Benjamin, or until you come 
to that which you have translated, 
which you have retained; 

42. And behold, you shall pub- 
lish it as the record of Nephi; and 
thus I will confound those who 
have altered my words. 

43. I will not suffer that they 
shall destroy my work; yea, I will 
show unto them that my wisdom 
is greater than the cunning of 
the devil. 

44. Behold, they have only got 
a part, or an abridgment of the 
account of Nephi. 

45. Behold, there are many 
things engraven upon the plates 
of Nephi which do throw greater 
views upon my gospel ; therefore, 
it is wisdom in me that you should 
translate this first part of the en- 
gravings of Nephi, and send forth 
in this work. 

46. And, behold, all the re- 
mainder of this work does con- 
tain all those parts of my gospel 
which my holy prophets, yea, and 
also my disciples, c desired in their 
prayers should come forth unto 
this people. 

47. And I said unto them, that 
it should be granted unto them 
according to their faith in their 
prayers ; 

48. Yea, and this was their

faith — that my gospel, which I 
gave unto them that they might 
preach in their days, might come 
unto their brethren the Laman- 
ites, and also all that had become 
Lamanites because of their dis- 
sensions. 

49. Now, this is not all — their 
faith in their prayers was that 
this gospel should be made known 
also, if it were possible that other 
nations should possess this land; 

50. And thus they did leave a 
blessing upon this land in their 
prayers, that whosoever should 
believe in this gospel in this land 
might have eternal life; 

51. Yea, that it might be free 
unto all of whatsoever nation, 
kindred, tongue, or people they 
may be. 

52. And now, behold, accord- 
ing to their faith in their prayers 
will I bring this part of my gospel 
to the knowledge of my people. 
Behold, I do not bring it to de- 
stroy that which they have re- 
ceived, but to build it up. 

53. And for this cause have I 
said: If this generation harden 
not their hearts, I will establish 
- my church among them. 

54. Now I do not say this to 
destroy my church, but I say this 
to build up my church; 

55. Therefore, whosoever be- 
longeth to my church need not 
fear, for such shall inherit the 
kingdom of heaven. 

56. But it is they who do not 
fear me, neither keep my com- 
mandments v but build up churches 
unto themselves to get gain, yea, 
and all those that do wickedly 
and build up the kingdom of the 
devil — yea, verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that it is they that I 



will disturb, and cause to tremble 
and shake to the center. 

57. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, 
the Son of God. I came unto 
'mine own, and mine own re- 
ceived me not. 

58. I am the light which r shin- 
eth in darkness, and the darkness 
comprehendeth it not. 

59. I am he who said — "Other 
sheep have I which are not of 
this fold — unto my disciples, and 
many there were that understood 
me not. 

60. And I will show unto this 
people that I had other sheep, 
and that they were a branch of 
the house of Jacob; 

61. And I will bring to light 
their marvelous works, which 
they did in my name; 

62. Yea, and I will also bring 
to light my gospel which was 
ministered unto them, and, be- 
hold, they shall not deny that 
which you have received, but 
they shall build it up, and shall 
bring to light the Hrue points of 
my doctrine, yea, and the only 
doctrine which is in me. 

63. And this I do that I may 
establish my gospel, that there 
may not be so much contention; 
yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts 
of the people to Contention con- 
cerning the points of my doc- 
trine; and in these things they 
do err, for they do wrest the 
scriptures and do not understand 
them. 

64. Therefore, I will unfold 
unto them this great mystery; 

65. For, behold, I will 'gather 
them as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, if they 
will not harden their hearts; 

66. Yea, if they will come, they

or less than this, the same is not 
of me, but is against me; there- 
fore he is not of my church.

ever is of my church, and en- 
dureth of my church to the end, 
him will I establish upon my rock, 
and the 'gates of hell shall not 
prevail against them.

words of him who is the ••life

SECTION 11. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to his 
brother, Hyrum Smith, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, May, 1829. This 
revelation was received through the Urim and Thummim in answer to 

Joseph's supplication and inquiry. The coming forth of a great 

and marvelous work proclaimed^— Hyrum restrained from preaching 
for the time being, he not being yet baptized and ordained — He is 
assured of the gift of God awaiting his preparation to receive — The 
organization of the Church foreshadowedr-—Hyrum admonished to 
learn the word of God before attempting to proclaim it — Warned 
against denying the spirit of revelation and prophecy. 



1. A great and "marvelous work 
is about to come forth among the 
children of men. 

2. Behold, I am God; give heed 
to my word, which is quick and 
powerful, sharper than a two- 
edged sword, to the dividing 
asunder of both joints and mar- 
row; therefore give heed unto my 
word. 

3. Behold, the field is "white 
already to harvest; therefore, 
whoso desireth to reap let him 
thrust in his sickle with his might, 
and reap while the day lasts, that 
he may treasure up for his soul 
everlasting salvation in the king- 
dom of God. 

4. Yea, whosoever will thrust 
in his sickle and reap, the same 
is called of God. 

5. Therefore, if you will c ask 



of me you shall receive; if you 
will knock it shall be opened unto 
you. 

6. Now, as you have asked, be- 
hold, I say unto you, keep my 
commandments, and seek to 
"bring forth and establish the 
cause of Zion. 

7. Seek not for riches but for 
wisdom; and, behold, the mys- 
teries of God shall be unfolded 
unto you, and then shall you be 
made rich. Behold, he that hath 
eternal life is rich. 

8. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, even as you desire of me so 
it shall be done unto you; and, 
if you desire, you shall be the 
means of doing much good in this 
generation. 

9. Say nothing but repentance 
unto this generation. Keep my

10. Behold, thou hast a gift, 
or thou shalt have a gift if thou 
wilt desire of me in faith, with

power of Jesus Christ, or in my

say unto thee, put your trust in 
that Spirit which leadeth to do 
good — yea, to do justly, to walk 
humbly, to judge righteously; 
and this is my Spirit. 

13. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, I will impart unto you of my 
Spirit, which shall enlighten your 
mind, which shall fill your soul 
with joy; 

14. And then shall ye know, or 
by this shall you know, all things 
whatsoever you desire of me, 
which are pertaining unto things 
of righteousness, in faith believ- 
ing in me that you shall receive. 

15. Behold, I command you 
that you need not suppose that 
you are called to preach until you 
are called. 

16. Wait a little longer, until 
you shall have my word, my 
rock, *my church, and my gospel, 
that you may know of a surety 
my doctrine. 

17. And then, behold, accord- 
ing to your desires, yea, even ac- 
cording to your faith shall it be 
done unto you. 

18. Keep my commandments; 
hold your peace; appeal unto my 
Spirit;

all your heart, that you may as-

sist in bringing to light those 
things of which has been spoken 
— yea, the translation of my 
work; be patient until you shall 
accomplish it. 

20. Behold, this is your work, 
to keep my commandments, yea, 
with all your might, mind and 
strength. 

21. Seek not to declare my 
word, but first seek to obtain my 
word, and then shall your tongue 
be loosed; then, if you desire, you 
shall have my Spirit and my word, 
yea, the power of God unto the 
convincing of men. 

22. But now hold your peace; 
study my word which 'hath gone 
forth among the children of men, 
and also study my word which 
shall come forth among the chil- 
dren of men, or that which is 
'now translating, yea, until you 
have obtained all which I shall 
grant unto the children of men 
in this generation, and then shall 
all things be added thereto. 

23. Behold thou art Hyrum, 
my son; seek the kingdom of God, 
and all things shall be added ac- 
cording to that which is just. 

24. Build upon my rock, which 
is my gospel; 

25. Deny not the spirit of 
revelation, nor the spirit of proph- 
ecy, for "wo unto him that denieth 
these things; 

26. Therefore, treasure up in 
your heart until the time which 
is in my wisdom that you shall 
go forth. 

27. Behold, I speak unto all 
who have good desires, and have 
thrust in their sickle to reap.

the Son of God. I am the *life 
and the light of the world.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Joseph 
Knight, Sen., at Harmony, Pennsylvania, May, 1829. Joseph Knight 
believed the declarations of Joseph Smith, concerning his possession of 
the Book of Mormon plates, and the work of translation then in 
progress, and had given material assistance to the translator and his 

scribe. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 47. Great and 

marvelous character of the Lord's work — Personal participation in the 
bringing forth and establishment of the cause of Zion open to all who 
have earnest desires and who possess the requisite qualifications. 



1. A great and "marvelous work 
is about to come forth among the 
children of men. 

2. Behold, I am God; give heed 
to my word, which is quick and 
powerful, sharper than a two- 
edged sword, to the dividing 
asunder of both joints and mar- 
row; therefore, give heed unto 
my word. 

3. Behold, the field is *white 
already to harvest; therefore, 
whoso desireth to reap let him 
thrust in his sickle with his might, 
and reap while the day lasts, that 
he may treasure up for his soul 
everlasting salvation in the king- 
dom of God. 

4. Yea, whosoever will thrust 
in his sickle and reap, the same 
is called of God. 

5. Therefore, if you will c ask 
of me you shall receive; if you 



will knock it shall be opened unto 
you. 

6. Now, as you have asked, be- 
hold, I say unto you, keep my com- 
mandments, and seek to "bring 
forth and establish the cause of 
Zion. 

7. Behold, I speak unto you, 
and also to all those who have 
desires to bring forth and estab- 
lish this work; 

8. And no one can assist in 
this work except he shall be hum- 
ble and full of love, having faith, 
hope, and charity, being temper- 
ate in all things, whatsoever shall 
be entrusted to his care. 

9. Behold, I am the 'light and 
the life of the world, that speak 
these words, therefore give heed 
with your might, and then you 
are called. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to David 
Whitmer, at Fayette, New York, June, 1829. The Whitmer family 
had become greatly interested in the translating of the Book of Mor- 
mon. Joseph changed his residence to the Whitmer home, where he 
dwelt until the work of translation was carried to completion and the 
copyright on the forthcoming book secured. Each of the three sons, 
having received a testimony as to the genuineness of the work, became 
deeply concerned over the matter of his individual duty; and the 
Prophet inquired of the Lord respecting the matter. This revelation 
and the two next following (Sections 15 and 16) were given in answer, 
through the TJrim and Thummim. See History of the Church, vol. 1, 
p. 48. David Whitmer later became one of the Three Witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon. Conditions of attaining eternal life speci- 
fied — The Lord's purpose of bringing the fulness of his Gospel from 
the Gentiles to the house of Israel — David Whitmer informed of his 
call to assist in the latter-day work — His reward, conditioned by his 
faithfulness, is promised.

SECTION 17. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Oliver 
Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, at Fayette, New York, 
June, 1829, prior to their viewing the engraved plates that contained 
the Book of Mormon record. Joseph and his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, 
had learned from the translation of certain passages on the Book of 
Mormon plates that three special witnesses- would be designated. See 
Ether 5:2-4; also 2 Nephi 11:3, and 27:12. Oliver Cowdery, David 
Whitmer and Martin Harris were moved upon by an inspired desire 
to be the three special witnesses. The Prophet inquired of the Lord, 
and this revelation was given in answer, through the TJrim and Thum- 
mim. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 52. The three condi- 
tionally promised that they shall be permitted to view not only the 
plates but also other sacred relics of Book of Mormon record — Only 
by faith like unto that of the prophets of old can thetf be thus privi- 
leged — They to testify of what they shall see — Joseph Smith's solemn 
avowals to be supported-— The Lord declares that as he lives the trans- 
lation is true. 

1. Behold, I say unto you, that 
you must rely upon my word, 
which if you do with full pur- 



pose of heart, you shall have a

he talked, with the Lord face to 
face, and the 'miraculous direc-

while in the wilderness, on the 
borders of the Red Sea. 

2. And it is by your faith that 
you shall obtain a view of them, 
even by that faith which was had 
by the prophets of old. 

3. And after that you have ob- 
tained faith, and have seen them 
with your eyes, you shall testify 
of them, by the power of God; 

4. And this you shall do that 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., 
may not be destroyed, that I may 
bring about my righteous pur- 
poses unto the children of men 
in this work. 

5. And ye shall testify that 
you have- seen them, even as my 
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., has 



seen them; for it is by my power 
that he has seen them, and it is 
because he had faith. 

6. And he 'has translated the 
book, even that part which I have 
commanded him, and as your 
Lord and your God liveth it is 
true. 

7. Wherefore, you have re- 
ceived the same power, and the 
same faith, and the same gift like 
unto him; 

8. And if you do these last 
commandments of mine, which I 
have given you, 'the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against you; for 
my grace is sufficient for you, and 
you shall be *lif ted up at the last 
day.

Lord and your God, have spoken 
it unto you, that I might bring 
about my righteous purposes unto 
the children of men. Amen.

1. Now, behold, because of the 
thing which you, my servant 
Oliver Cowdery, have desired to 
know of me, I give unto you these 
words: 

2. Behold, I have manifested 
unto you, by my Spirit in many 
instances, that the things which 
you have written are true; where- 
fore you know that they are true. 

3. And if you know that they 
are true, behold, I give unto you 
a commandment, that you rely 
upon the things which are writ- 
ten; 

4. For in them are all things 
written concerning the founda- 
tion of °my church, my 6 gospel, 
and my rock. 

5. Wherefore, if you shall build 
up my church, upon the founda-' 
tion of my gospel and my rock, 
the c gates of hell shall not pre- 
vail against you. 

6. Behold, the world is ripen- 
ing in iniquity; and it must needs 
be that the children of men are 
stirred up unto repentance, both 
the Gentiles and also the house 
of Israel. 

7. Wherefore, as thou hast 
been baptized by the hands of 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., 
according to that which I have 
commanded him, he hath fulfilled 
the thing which I commanded 
him. 

8. And now, marvel not that 
I have called him unto mine own 
purpose, which purpose is known 
in me; wherefore, if he shall be 
diligent in keeping my command- 
ments he shall be blessed unto 



eternal life; and his name is 
Joseph. 

9. And now, Oliver Cowdery, 
I speak unto you, and also unto 
David Whitmer, by the way of 
commandment; for, behold, I 
command all men everywhere to 
repent, and I speak unto you, 
even as unto Paul mine apostle, 
for you are called even with that 
same calling with which he was 
called. 

10. Remember the worth of 
souls is great in the sight of God; 

11. For, behold, the Lord your 
Redeemer suffered death in the 
flesh; wherefore he suffered the 
e pain of all men, that all men 
might repent and come unto him. 

12. And he hath risen again 
from the dead, that he might 
bring all men unto him, on con- 
ditions of 'repentance. 

13. And how great is his joy 
in the soul that repenteth! 

14. Wherefore, you are called 
to cry repentance unto this peo- 
ple. 

15. And if it so be that you 
should labor all your days in cry- 
ing repentance unto this people, 
and bring, save it be one soul unto 
me, how great shall be your joy 
with him in the kingdom of my 
Father! 

16. And now, if your joy will 
be great with one soul that you 
have brought unto me into the 
kingdom of my Father, how great 
will be your joy if you should 
bring many souls unto me! 

17. Behold, you have my 'gos- 
pel before you, and my rock, and 
my salvation.

purpose of heart, they are called 
to «go into all the world to preach 
my gospel unto every creature. 

29. And they are they who are 
ordained of me to 'baptize in my 
name, according to that which is 
written; 

30. And you have that which 
is written before you; wherefore, 
you must perform it according to 
the words which are written. 

31. And now I speak unto you, 
the Twelve — Behold, my grace is 
sufficient for you; you must walk 
uprightly before me and sin not. 

32. And, behold, you are they 
who are ordained of me to 'ordain 
priests and teachers; to declare 
my gospel, according to the power 
of the Holy Ghost which is in 
you, and according to the call- 
ings and gifts of God unto men; 

33. And I, Jesus Christ, your 
Lord and your God, have spoken 
it. 

34. These words are not of 
men nor of man, but of me; 
wherefore, you shall testify they 
are of me and not of man; 

35. For it is my voice which 
speaketh them unto you ; for they 
are given by my Spirit unto you, 
and by my power you can read 
them one to another; and save 
it were by my power you could 
not have them; 

36. Wherefore, you can testify 
that you have heard my voice, 
and know my words. 

37. And now, behold, I give 
unto you, Oliver Cowdery, and 
also unto David Whitmer, that 
you shall search out the Twelve, 
who shall have the desires of 
which I have spoken;

39. And when you have found 
them you shall show these things 
unto them. 

40. And you shall fall down 
and worship the Father in my 
name. 

41. And you must preach unto 
the world, saying: You must 're- 
pent and be "baptized, in the 
name of Jesus Christ; 

42. For all men must repent 
and be baptized, and not only 
men, but women, and children 
who have arrived at the 'years 
of accountability. 

43. And now, after that you 
have received this, you must keep 
my commandments in all things; 



44. And by your hands I will 
work a •'marvelous work among 
the children of men, unto the 
convincing of many of their sins, 
that they may come unto repen- 
tance, and that they may come 
unto the kingdom of my Father. 

45. Wherefore, the blessings 
which I give unto you are 'above 
all things. 

46. And after that you have 
received this, if you keep not my 
commandments you cannot be 
saved in the kingdom of my Fa- 
ther.

your Lord and your God, and 
your Redeemer, by the power of 
my Spirit have spoken it. Amen. 



SECTION 19. 



A Commandment of God, and not of man, revealed through Joseph 
Smith the Prophet, to Martin Harris, at Manchester, New York, March, 

1830, by him who is Eternal. *- Christ affirms his omnipotence — 

Declares that punishment and suffering are inevitable consequences of 
unrepented sins — Explains the signification of endless torment and 
eternal damnation — Reaffirms the actuality of his own suffering in the 
flesh — Emphasizes the necessity of prayer — Gives specific commandment 
to Martin Harris. 



1. I am Alpha and Qmega, 
Christ the Lord; yea, even I am 
he, the beginning and the end, 
the Redeemer of the world. 

2. I, having accomplished and 
finished the will of him whose I 
am, even the Father, concerning 
me — having done this that I 
might subdue all things unto my- 
self — 

3. Retaining "all power, even 
to the ^destroying of Satan and 
his works at the end of the world, 
and the last great day of Judg- 



ment, which I shall pass upon 
the inhabitants thereof, judging 
every man according to his works 
and the deeds which he hath done. 

4. And surely every man must 
c repent or suffer, for I, God, am 
'endless. 

5. Wherefore, I revoke not the 
judgments which I shall pass, but 
woes shall go forth, 'weeping, 
wailing and gnashing of teeth, 
yea, to those who are found on 
my left hand. 

6. Nevertheless, it is not writ-

ten that there shall be no end 
to this torment, but It is written 
f endless torment. 

7. Again, it is written "eternal 
damnation; wherefore it is more 
express than other scriptures, 
that it might work upon the 
hearts of the children of men, 
altogether for my name's glory. 

8. Wherefore, I will explain 
unto you this mystery, for it is 
meet unto you to know even as 
mine apostles. 

9. I speak unto you that are 
chosen in this thing, even as one, 
that you may enter into my rest. 

10. For, behold, the mystery 
of godliness, how great is it! 
For, behold, I am endless, and 
the punishment which is given 
from my hand is "endless punish- 
ment, for Endless is my name. 
Wherefore — 

11. * Eternal punishment is 
God's punishment. 

12. 'Endless punishment is 
God's punishment. 

13. Wherefore, I command you 
to repent, and keep the com- 
mandments which you have re- 
ceived by the hand of my servant 
Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name; 

14. And it is by my almighty 
power that you have received 
them; 

15. Therefore I command you 
to repent — repent, lest I smite 
you by the rod of my mouth, and 
by my wrath, and by my anger, 
and your sufferings be sore — how 
sore you know not, how exquisite 
you know not, yea, how hard to 
bear you know not. 

16. For behold, I, God, *have 
suffered these things for all, that 
they might not suffer if they 
would repent; 



17. But if they would not re- 
pent they must suffer even as I; 

18. Which suffering caused 
myself, even God, the greatest of 
all, to tremble because of pain, 
and to 'bleed at every pore, and 
to suffer both body and spirit— 
and would that I might not drink 
the bitter cup, and shrink — 

19. Nevertheless, glory be to 
the Father, and I partook and fin- 
ished my preparations unto the 
children of men. 

20. Wherefore, I command you 
again to repent, lest I humble you 
with my almighty power; and 
that you confess your sins, lest 
you suffer these punishments of 
which I have spoken, of which in 
the smallest, yea, even in the 
least degree you have tasted at 
the time I withdrew my Spirit. 

21. And I command you that 
you preach naught but repent- 
ance, and show not these things 
unto the world until it is wisdom 
in me. 

22. For they cannot m bear 
meat now, but milk they must re- 
ceive; wherefore, they must not 
know these things, lest they per- 
ish. 

23. Learn of me, and listen to 
my words; walk in the meekness 
of my Spirit, and you shall have 
peace in me. 

24. I am Jesus Christ; I came 
by the will of the Father, and I 
do his will. 

25. And again, I command thee 
that thou shalt not "covet thy 
neighbor's wife; nor seek thy 
neighbor's life. 

26. And again, I command thee 
that thou shalt not covet thine 
own property, but impart it freely

27. Which is my "word to the 
Gentile, that soon it may go to 
the Jew, of whom the Lamanites 
are a "remnant, that they may be- 
lieve the gospel, and look not for 
a Messiah to come who has al- 
ready come. 

28. And again, I command thee 
that thou shalt pray vocally as 
well as in thy heart; yea, before 
the world as well as in secret, in 
public as well as in private. 

29. And thou shalt declare 
«glad tidings, yea, publish it upon 
the mountains, and upon every 
high place, and among every peo- 
ple that thou shalt be permitted 
to see. 

30. And thou shalt do it with 
all humility, trusting in me, re- 
viling not against revilers. 

31. And of tenets thou shalt 
not talk, but thou shalt declare 
'repentance and faith on the 
Savior, and 'remission of sins by 
baptism and by 'fire, yea, even 
the Holy Ghost. 

32. Behold, this is a great and 
the last commandment which I 
shall give unto you concerning 
this matter; for this shall suffice 
for thy daily walk, even unto the 
end of thy life. 



33. And misery thou shalt re- 
ceive if thou wilt slight these 
counsels, yea, even the destruc- 
tion of thyself and property. 

34. Impart a portion of thy 
property, yea, even part of thy 
lands, and all save the support of 
thy family. 

35. Pay the debt thou hast con- 
tracted with the printer. Release 
thyself from bondage. 

36. Leave thy house and home, 
except when thou shalt desire to 
see thy family; 

37. And speak freely to all; 
yea, preach, exhort, declare the 
truth, even with a loud voice, 
with a sound of rejoicing, crying 
— Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be 
the name of the Lord God ! 

38. "Pray always, and I will 
pour out my Spirit upon you, and 
great shall be your blessing — yea, 
even more than if you should ob- 
tain treasures of earth and cor- 
ruptibleness to the extent thereof. 

39. Behold, canst thou read 
this without rejoicing and lifting 
up thy heart for gladness? 

40. Or canst thou run about 
longer as a blind guide? 

41. Or canst thou be humble 
and meek, and conduct thyself 
wisely before me? Yea, come 
unto me thy Savior. Amen.

Revelation on Church Organization and Government, given 
through Joseph Smith the Prophet, April, 1830. Preceding his record 
of this revelation the Prophet wrote: We obtained of him [Jesus 
Christ] the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation; which 
not only gave us much information, but also pointed out to us the 
precise day upon which, according to his will and commandment, we 
should proceed to organize his Church once more here upon the 

earth. The Lord again attests the genuineness of the Book of 

Mormon — He gives commandment respecting baptism — Defines the

functions of the several offices in the Priesthood — Specifies the duties 
of members — Prescribes the mode of baptism, and of administering the 
sacrament of bread and wine — Directs the keeping of records of Church 
membership. 



1. The "rise of the Church of 
Christ in these last days, being 
*one thousand eight hundred and 
thirty years since the coming of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 
in the flesh, it being regularly 
organized and established agree- 
able to the laws of our country, 
by the will and commandments of 
God, in the fourth month, and on 
the 'sixth day of the month which 
is called April — 

2. Which commandments were 
given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who 
was called of God, and ordained 
an d apostle of Jesus Christ, to be 
the first elder of this church; 

3. And to Oliver Cowdery, who 
was also called of God, an 'apostle 
of Jesus Christ, to be the second 
elder of this church, and ordained 
under his hand; 

4. And this according to the 
grace of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, 
both now and forever. Amen. 

5. After it was truly mani- 
fested unto this first elder that he 
had received a remission of his 
Bins, he was entangled again in 
the vanities of the world; 

6. But after repenting, and 
humbling himself sincerely, 
through faith, God ministered 
unto him by an 'holy angel, whose 
countenance was as lightning, and 
whose garments were pure and 
white above all other whiteness; 

7. And gave unto him com- 
mandments which inspired him; 

8. And gave him power from 



on high, by the "means which 
were before prepared, to trans- 
late the Book of Mormon; 

9. Which contains a record of 
a fallen people, and the "fulness 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ to 
the Gentiles and to the Jews also; 

10. Which was given by in- 
spiration, and is confirmed to 
'others by the ministering of 
angels, and is declared unto the 
world by them — 

11. Proving to the world that 
the holy scriptures are true, and 
that God does inspire men and 
call them to his holy work in 
this age and generation, as well 
as in generations of old; 

12. Thereby showing that he 
is the 'same God yesterday, today, 
and forever. Amen 

13. Therefore, having so great 
witnesses, by them shall the world 
be judged, even as many as shall 
hereafter come to a knowledge 
of this work. 

14. And those who receive it 
in faith, and work righteousness, 
shall receive a crown of eternal 
life; 

15. But those who harden their 
hearts in unbelief, and reject it, 
it shall turn to their own condem- 
nation — 

16. For the Lord God has 
spoken it; and we, the elders of 
the church, have *heard and bear 
witness to the words of the glori- 
ous Majesty on high, to whom be 
glory forever and ever. Amen.

that there is a God in heaven, 
who is infinite and eternal, from 
•"everlasting to everlasting the 
same unchangeable God, the 
framer of heaven and earth, and 
all things which are in them; 

18. And that he created man, 
male and female, after his "own 
image and in his own likeness, 
created he them; 

19. And gave unto them com- 
mandments that they should love 
and serve him, the only living 
and true God, and that he should 
be the only . being whom they 
should worship. 

20. But by the transgression 
of these holy laws man became 
sensual and devilish, and became 
fallen man. 

21. Wherefore, the Almighty 
God gave his Only Begotten Son, 
as it is written in those scrip- 
tures which have been given of 
him. 

22. He suffered temptations 
but gave no heed unto them. 

23. He was "crucified, died, and 
'rose again the third day; 

24. And ascended into heaven, 
to sit down on the right hand of 
the Father, to reign with al- 
mighty power according to the 
will of the Father; 

25. That as many as would 
^believe and be r baptized in his 
holy name, and endure in faith to 
the end, should be saved — 

26. Not only those who be- 
lieved after he came in the 'merid- 
ian of time, in the flesh, but all 
those from the beginning, even 
as many as were before he came, 



who believed in the words of the 
holy prophets, who spake as they 
were 'inspired by the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, who truly testified 
of him in all things, should have 
eternal life, 

27. As well as those who should 
come after, who should believe in 
the "gifts and callings of God by 
the Holy Ghost, which 'beareth 
record of the Father and of the 
Son; 

28. Which Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost are "'one God, 'infinite 
and eternal, without end. Amen. 

29. And we "know that all men 
must repent and believe on the 
name of Jesus Christ, and wor- 
ship the Father in his name, and 
endure in faith on his name to 
the end, or they cannot be saved 
in the kingdom of God. 

30. And we *know that justi- 
fication, through the grace of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is 
just and true; 

31. And we 2a know also, that 
sanctification through the grace 
of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ is just and true, to all 
those who love and serve God 
with all their mights, minds, and 
strength. 

32. But there is a possibility 
that man may 2ft fall from grace 
and depart from the living God; 

33. Therefore let the church 
take heed and pray always, lest 
they fall into temptation; 

34. Yea, and even let those 
who are sanctified take heed also.

things are true and according to

n the home of Peter Whitmer, Sen. Six men, who had previously 
)een baptized, participated. By unanimous vote these expressed their 
lesire and determination to organize, according to the commandment 
)f God; see Section 20. They also voted to accept and sustain Joseph 
"Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery as the presiding officers of the Church. 
With the laying on of hands, Joseph then ordained Oliver an Elder of 
he Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and Oliver similarly 
irdained Joseph. After administration 6f the sacrament, Joseph and

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was established 
in these last days, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred 
and thirty. Given at Manchester, New York, April, 1830, in con- 
sequence of some who had previously been baptized desiring to unite 
with the Church without re-baptism. The indispensability of bap- 
tism in the way prescribed and through the authority given by the 
Lord is set forth. 



1. Behold, I say unto you that 
all °old covenants have I caused 
to be done away in this ihing; 
and this is a *new and an ever- 
lasting covenant, even that which 
was from the beginning. 

2. Wherefore, although a man 
should be baptized an hundred 
times it availeth him nothing, for 
you cannot enter in at the strait 



gate by the law of Moses, neither 
by your dead works. 

3. For it is because of your 
dead works that I have caused 
this c last covenant and this 
d church to be built up unto me, 
even as in days of old.

the "gate, as I have commanded, 
and seek not to counsel your God.

things which thou hast not seen, 
for they are withheld from thee 
and from the world, which is wis- 
dom in me in a time to come. 

5. And the office of thy calling 
shall be for a comfort unto my 
servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy 
husband, in his afflictions, with 
consoling words, in the spirit of 
meekness. 

6. And thou shalt go with him 
at the time of his going, and be 
unto him for a scribe, while there 
is no one to be a scribe for him, 
that I may send my servant, 
Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I 
will. 

7. And thou shalt be ordained 
under his hand to expound scrip- 
tures, and to exhort the church, 
according as it shall be given thee 
by my Spirit. 

8. For he shall lay his hands 
upon thee, and thou shalt receive 



the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall 
be given to writing, and to learn- 
ing much. 

9. And thou needest not fear, 
for thy husband shall support 
thee in the church ; for unto them 
is his calling, that all things 
might be revealed unto them, 
whatsoever I will, according to 
their faith. 

10. And verily I say unto thee 
that thou shalt lay aside the 
things of this world, and seek for 
the things of a better. 

11. And it shall be given thee, 
also, to make a Selection of 
sacred hymns, as it shall be given 
thee, which is pleasing unto me, 
to be had in my church. 

12. For my soul delighteth in 
the song of the heart; yea, the 
d song of the righteous is a prayer 
unto me, and it shall be answered 
with a blessing upon their heads. 

13. Wherefore, lift up thy 
heart and rejoice, and cleave unto 
the covenants which thou hast 
made. 

14. Continue in the spirit of 
meekness, and beware of pride. 
Let thy soul delight' in thy hus- 
band, and the glory which shall 
come upon him. 

15. Keep my commandments 
continually, and a crown of right- 
eousness thou shalt receive. And 
except thou do this, where I am 
you cannot come. 

16. And verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that this is my voice 
unto all. Amen.

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, 
Pennsylvania, August, 1830. In preparation for a religious service 
at which the sacrament of bread and wine was to be administered, 
Joseph set out to procure wine for the occasion. He was met by a 
heavenly messenger, and received this revelation, the first four para- 
graphs of which were written at the time, and the remainder in the 
September following. Water is commonly used instead of wine in 

the sacramental services of the Church. Warning against the use 

of wine of unassured purity in the sacrament — Many ancient prophets 
named, with whom, as with the latter-day prophets, the Lord promises 
to partake at a time yet to come — The prior ordination of Joseph 
Smith, Jun. y and Oliver Cowdery to the Apostleship avowed — En- 
couraging admonition given. 

I give unto you, that you c shall 
not purchase wine neither strong 
drink of your enemies; 

4. Wherefore, you shall par- 
take of none except it is made 
new among you; yea, in this my 
Father's kingdom which shall be 
built up on the earth. 

5. Behold, this is wisdom in 
me; wherefore, marvel not, for 
the hour cometh that I will 
d drink of the fruit of the vine 
with you on the earth, and with 
Moroni, whom I have sent unto 
you to reveal the Book of Mor- 



: 



1. Listen to the voice of Jesus 
Christ, your Lord, your God, and 
your Redeemer, whose word is 
•quick and powerful. 

2. For, behold, I say unto you, 
that it ft mattereth not what ye 
shall eat or what ye shall drink 
when ye partake of the sacra- 
ment, if it so be that ye do it with 
an eye single to my glory — re- 
membering unto the Father my 
body which was laid down for 
you, and my blood which was shed 
for the remission of your sins.

SECTION 28. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Oliver 
Cowdery, at Fayette, New York, September, 1830. Hiram Page, a 
member of the Church, had a certain stone, and professed to be receiv- 
ing revelations by its aid concerning the upbuilding of Zion and the 
order of the Church. Several members had been deceived by these 
claims, and even Oliver Cowdery was wrongly influenced thereby. Just 
prior to an appointed conference, the Prophet inquired earnestly of 
the Lord concerning the matter and this revelation followed. See His- 
tory of the Church, vol. 1, p. 109. Joseph's position of presidency 

defined — Oliver warned against undue assumption — Oliver's mission to 
the Lamanites stated — He to labor with Hiram Page, whom Satan had 
deceived — Hiram Page not appointed by the Lord nor accepted by the 
people as a revelator to the Church. 

1. Behold, I say unto thee, 
Oliver, that it shall be given unto 
thee that thou shalt be heard by 



the church in all things whatso- 
ever thou shalt teach them by the 
Comforter, concerning the revela- 
tions and commandments which 
I have given. 

2. But, behold, verily, verily, 
I say unto thee, a no one shall be 
appointed to receive command- 
ments and revelations in this 
church excepting my servant 
Joseph Smith, Jun., for he re- 
ceiveth them even as Moses. 

3. And thou shalt be obedient 
unto the things which I shall give 
unto him, even as Aaron, to de- 
clare faithfully the command- 
ments and the revelations, with 
power and authority unto the 
church. 

4. And if thou art led at any 
time by the Comforter to speak 
or teach, or at all times by the 
way of commandment unto the 
church, thou mayest do it. 

5. But thou shalt not write by 
way of commandment, but by 
wisdom ; 

6. And thou shalt not com- 
mand him who is at thy head, 



and at the head of the church; 
r. 7. For I have given him the 
'fckeys of the mysteries, and the 
revelations which are sealed, 
until I shall appoint unto them 
another in his stead. 

8. And now, behold, I say unto 
you that you shall go unto the 
Lamanites and preach my gospel 
unto them; and inasmuch as they 
receive thy teachings thou shalt 
cause c my church to be estab- 
lished among them; and thou 
shalt have revelations, but write 
them not by way of command- 
ment. 

9. And now, behold, I say unto 
you that it is not revealed, and 
no man knoweth where d the city 
Zion shall be built, but it shall 
be given hereafter. Behold, I 
say unto you that it shall be on 
the borders by the Lamanites. 

10. Thou shalt not leave this 
place until after the conference; 
and my servant Joseph shall be 
appointed to preside over the con- 
ference by the voice of it, and 
what he saith to thee thou shalt 
tell. 

11. And again, thou shalt take 
thy brother, Hiram Page, between

liim and thee alone, and tell him 
that those things which he hath 
"written from that stone are not of 
me, and that Satan e deceiveth him ; 

12. For, behold, these things 
liave not been appointed unto 
liim, neither shall anything be 
appointed unto any of this church 
contrary to the church covenants. 

13. For all things must be 
done in order, and by 'common 
consent in the 'church, by the 
prayer of faith. 



14. And thou shalt assist to 
settle all these things, according 
to the covenants of the church, 
before thou shalt take thy jour- 
ney among the Lamanites. 

15. And it shall be given thee 
from the time thou shalt go, until 
the time thou shalt return, what 
thou shalt do. 

16. And thou must open thy 
mouth at all times, declaring my 
gospel with the sound of rejoic- 
ing. Amen. 



SECTION 29. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in the presence 
of six Elders, at Fayette, New York, September, 1830. This revelation 
was given some days prior to the conference beginning September 26, 

1830. The gathering of the elect specified — The imminence of the 

Lord's advent affirmed — Calamities incident to the sinful state of the 
world — The Millennium and scenes of judgment to follow — Distinction 
between the spiritual and temporal creations — Purpose of the mortal 
probation — The agency of man — The assured redemption of children 
who die in infancy. 



1. Listen to the voice of Jesus 
Christ, your Redeemer, the Great 
I Am, whose arm of mercy hath 
atoned for your sins; 

2. Who will "gather his people 
even as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, even 
as many as will hearken to my 
voice and humble themselves be- 
fore me, and call upon me in 
mighty prayer. 

3. Behold, verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that at this time your 
sins are forgiven you, therefore 
ye receive these things; but re- 
member to sin no more, lest perils 
shall come upon you. 

4. Verily, I say unto you that 
ye are chosen out of the world 
to declare my gospel with the 
sound of rejoicing, »as with the 
voice of a trump. 

5. Lift up your hearts and be 



glad, for I am in your midst, and 
am your advocate with the Fa- 
ther; and it is his good will to 
give you the kingdom. 

6. And, as it is written — 
e Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith, 
being united in prayer according 
to my command, ye shall receive. 

7. And ye are called to bring 
to pass the fathering of mine 
elect; for mine elect hear my 
voice and harden not their hearts; 

8. Wherefore the decree hath 
gone forth from the Father that 
they shall be gathered in unto 
'one place upon the face of this 
land, to prepare their hearts and 
be prepared in all things against 
the day when 'tribulation and 
desolation are sent forth upon 
the wicked.

earth is ripe; and all the proud 
and they that do wickedly shall 
be as stubble; and I will "burn 
them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, 
that wickedness shall not be upon 
the earth; 

10. For the hour is nigh, and 
that which was spoken by mine 
apostles must be fulfilled; for as 
they spoke so shall it come to 
pass; 

11. For I will reveal 4 myself 
from heaven with power and 
great glory, with all the hosts 
thereof, and dwell in righteous- 
ness with men on earth a 'thou- 
sand years, and the wicked shall 
not stand. 

12. And again, verily, verily, 
I say unto you, and it hath gone 
forth in a firm decree, by the will 
of the Father, that mine apostles, 
the Twelve which were with me 
in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall 
stand at my right hand at the 
day of my coming in a pillar of 
fire, being clothed with robes of 
righteousness, with *crowns upon 
their heads, in glory even as I am, 
to judge the whole house of 
Israel, even as many as have loved 
me and kept my commandments, 
and none else. 

13. For a 'trump shall sound 
both long and loud, even as upon 
Mount Sinai, and all the earth 
shall quake, and they shall come 
forth — yea, m even the dead which 
died in me, to receive a crown of 
righteousness, and to be clothed 
upon, even as I am, to be with 
me, that we may be one. 

14. But, behold, I say unto you 
that before this great day shall 



come the "sun shall be darkened, 
and the moon shall be turned into 
blood, and the stars shall fall 
from heaven, and there shall be 
greater signs in heaven above 
and in the earth beneath; 

15. And there shall be ° weep- 
ing and wailing among the hosts 
of men; 

16. And there shall be a 'great 
hailstorm sent forth to destroy 
the crops of the earth. 

17. And it shall come to pass, 
because of the wickedness of the 
world, that I will take ^vengeance 
upon the wicked, for they will not 
repent; for the cup of mine in- 
dignation is full; for behold, my 
blood shall not cleanse them if 
they hear me not. 

18. Wherefore, I the Lord God 
will send forth r fiies upon the 
face of the earth, which shall 
take hold of the inhabitants 
thereof, and shall eat their flesh, 
and shall cause maggots to come 
in upon them; 

19. And their tongues shall be 
stayed that they shall not utter 
against me; and their flesh shall 
fall from off their bones, and 
their eyes from their sockets; 

20. And it shall come to pass 
that the 'beasts of the forest and 
the fowls of the air shall devour 
them up. 

21. And the great and 'abom- 
inable church, which is the whore 
of all the earth, shall be cast 
down by devouring fire, accord- 
ing as it is spoken by the mouth 
of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke 
of these things, which have not 
come to pass but surely must, as

I live, for abominations shall not 
reign. 

22. And again, verily, verily, 
I say unto you that when the 
"thousand years are ended, and 
men again begin to deny their 
God, then will I spare the earth 
but for a little season; 

23. And the end shall come, 
and the heaven and the earth 
shall be "consumed and pass away, 
and there shall be a new w heaven 
and a new earth. 

24. For all 'old things shall 
pass away, and all things shall 
become new, even the heaven and 
the earth, and all the fulness 
thereof, both men and beasts, the 
fowls of the air, and the fishes 
of the sea; 

25. And not one hair, neither 
mote, shall be lost, for it is the 
workmanship of mine hand. 

26. But, behold, verily I say 
unto you, before the earth shall 
pass away, 'Michael, mine arch- 
angel, shall sound his trump, and 
then shall all the dead awake, 
for their graves shall be opened, 
and they shall come forth — yea, 
even all. 

27. And the righteous shall be 
gathered on my right hand unto 
eternal life; and the wicked on 
my left hand will I be ashamed 
to own before the Father; 

28. Wherefore I will say unto 
them — 'Depart from me, ye 
cursed, into everlasting fire, pre- 
pared for the devil and his angels. 

29. And now, behold, I say 
unto you, never at any time have 
I declared from mine own mouth 
that they should return, for 
where I am they cannot come, 
for they have no power. 

30. But remember that all my 
Judgments are not given unto 



men; and as the words have gone 
forth out of my mouth even so 
shall they be fulfilled, that the 
2a first shall be last, and that the 
last shall be first in all things 
whatsoever I have created by the 
word of my power, which is the 
power of my Spirit. 

31. For by the power of my 
Spirit created I them; yea, all 
things both spiritual and tem- 
poral — 

32. First spiritual, secondly 
temporal, which is the 2 "begin- 
ning of my work; and again, first 
temporal, and secondly spiritual, 
which is the last 2c of my work — 

33. Speaking unto you that 
you may naturally understand; 
but unto myself my works have 
no end, neither beginning; but it 
is given unto you that ye may un- 
derstand, because ye have asked 
it of me and are agreed. 

34. Wherefore, verily I say 
unto you that all things unto me 
are spiritual, and not at any time 
have I given unto you a law which 
was temporal; neither any man, 
nor the children of men; neither 
Adam, your father, whom I cre- 
ated. 

35. Behold, I gave unto him 
that he should be an agent unto 
himself; and I gave unto him 
commandment, but no temporal 
commandment gave I unto him, 
for my commandments are spir- 
itual; they are not natural nor 
temporal, neither carnal nor sen- 
sual. 

36. And it came to pass that 
Adam, being tempted of the devil 
— for, behold, the 2d devil was be- 
fore Adam, for he rebelled against 
me, saying, Give me thine honor, 
which is my power; and also a

turned he away from me because 
of their agency; 

37. And they were * 'thrust 
down, and thus came the devil 
and his angels; 

38. And, behold, there is a 
place prepared for them from the 
beginning, which place is 2 'hell. 

39. And it must needs be that 
the devil should tempt the chil- 
dren of men, or they could not 
be agents unto themselves; for if 
they never should have bitter they 
could not know the sweet — 

40. Wherefore, it came to pass 
that the devil tempted Adam, and 
he partook of the forbidden fruit 
and transgressed the command- 
ment, wherein he became "sub- 
ject to the will of the devil, be- 
cause he yielded unto temptation. 

41. Wherefore, I, the Lord 
God, caused that he should be cast 
out from the Garden of Eden, 
2 *from my presence, because of 
his transgression, wherein he be- 
came 2i spiritually dead, which is 
the 2 *first death, even that same 
death which is the last death, 
which is spiritual, which shall be 
pronounced upon the wicked 
when I shall say: 2 'Depart, ye 
cursed. 

42. But, behold, I say unto you 
that I, the Lord God, gave unto 
Adam and unto his seed, that 
they should not die as to the tem- 
poral death, until I, the Lord 
God, should send forth 2m angels to 
declare unto them repentance and 



redemption, through faith on the 
name of mine Only Begotten Son. 

43. And thus did I, the Lord 
God, appoint unto man the days 
of his probation — that by his 
natural death he might be '"raised 
in immortality unto eternal life, 
even as many as would believe; 

44. And they that believe not 
unto 2o eternal damnation; for 
they cannot be redeemed from 
their spiritual fall, because they 
repent not; 

45. For they love darkness 
rather than light, and their deeds 
are evil, and they receive their 
wages of whom they list to obey. 

46. But, behold, I say unto 
you, that 2p little children are re- 
deemed from the foundation of 
the world through mine Only Be- 
gotten; 

47. Wherefore, they cannot 
sin, for power is not given unto 
Satan to 2 «tempt little children, 
until they begin to become ac- 
countable before me; 

48. For it is given unto them 
even as I will, according to mine 
own pleasure, that great things 
may be required at the hand of 
their fathers. 

49. And, again, I say unto you, 
that whoso having knowledge, 
have I not commanded to repent? 

50. And he that hath no un- 
derstanding, it remaineth in me 
to do according as it is written. 
And now I declare no more unto 
you at this time. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Ezra 
Thayre and Northrop Sweet, at Fayette, New York, October, 1830. 
In recording this revelation the Prophet avers that the Lord is ever 

ready to instruct such as diligently seek in faith. The corrupted 

state of the world declared — Call for laborers in the ministry — Bringing 
forth of the Church from the wilderness and its establishment by the 
Lord — Commission of the Elders to proclaim repentance and baptism — 
Imminence of the Lord's coming. 

1. Behold, I say unto you, my 
servants Ezra and Northrop, open 
ye your ears and hearken to the 
voice of the Lord your God, whose 
word is "quick and powerful, 
sharper than a two-edged sword, 
to the dividing asunder of the 
joints and marrow, soul and 
spirit; and is a discerner of the 
thoughts and intents of the heart. 

2. For verily, verily, I say unto 
you that ye are called to lift up 
your voices as with the sound of 
a trump, to declare my "gospel 
unto a crooked and perverse gen- 
eration. 



3. For behold, the field is 
'white already to harvest; and it 
is the Eleventh hour, and the 
"last time that I shall call laborers 
into my vineyard. 

4. And my vineyard has be- 
come corrupted 'every whit; and 
there is none which doeth good 
save it be a few; and they err in 
many instances because of 'priest- 
crafts, all having corrupt minds.

8. Open your mouths and they

wilderness. 

9. Yea, open your mouths and

for lo, I am with you. 

10. Yea, open your mouths and 
they shall be filled, saying: Re- 
pent, repent, and "prepare ye the 
way of the Lord, and make his 
paths straight; for the kingdom 
of heaven is at hand; 

11. Yea, 'repent and be bap- 
tized, every one of you, for a re- 
mission of your sins; yea, be bap- 
tized even by water, and then 
cometh the baptism of fire and 
of the Holy Ghost. 

12. Behold, verily, verily, I say 



unto you, this is my gospel; and 
remember that they shall have 
faith in me or they can in nowise 
be saved; 

13. And upon this m rock I will 
build my church; yea, upon this 
rock ye are built, and if ye con- 
tinue, the "gates of hell shall not 
prevail against you. 

14. And ye shall remember the 
church articles and covenants to 
keep them. 

15. And whoso having faith 
you shall confirm in my church, 
by the "laying on of the hands, 
and I will bestow the gift of the 
Holy Ghost upon them. 

16. And the Book of Mormon 
and the holy scriptures are given 
of me for your instruction; and 
the power of my Spirit quicken- 
eth all things. 

17. Wherefore, be faithful, 
praying always, having yonr 
'lamps trimmed and burning, and

write, behold, it shall be given 
unto him to prophesy; and thou 
shalt preach my gospel and call 
on the holy prophets to prove his 
words, as they shall be given him. 



24. Keep all the command- 
ments and covenants by which ye 
are bound; and I will cause the 
'heavens to shake for your good, 
and Satan shall tremble and 
"Zion shall rejoice upon the l hills 
and flourish; 

25. And Israel shall be saved 
in mine own due time; and by the 
"'keys which I have given shall 
they be led, and no more be con- 
founded at all. 

26. Lift up your hearts and 
be glad, your redemption draweth 
nigh. 

27. Fear not, little flock, 'the 
kingdom is yours until I come. 
Behold, I "come quickly. Even 
so. Amen.

Partridge, December, 1830. See heading to Section 35. The 

recipient instructed to preach — Every man may be commissioned in 
the ministry if he will comply with the Lord's requirements. 

1. Thus saith the Lord God, 
the Mighty One of Israel: Behold, 
I say unto you, my servant Ed- 
ward, that you are blessed, and 
your sins are forgiven you, and 
you are called to preach my gos- 
pel as with the voice of a trump; 

2. And I will lay my hand upon 
you by the a hand of my servant 
Sidney Rigdon, and you shall re- 
ceive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, 
even the Comforter, which shall 
teach you the peaceable things 
of the kingdom; 

3. And you shall declare it 
Trith a loud voice, saying: Ho- 
8anna, blessed be the name of the 
most high God. 

4. And now this calling and 



commandment give I unto you 
concerning all men — 

5. That as many as shall come 
before my servants Sidney Rig- 
don and Joseph Smith, Jun., em- 
bracing this calling and com- 
mandment, "shall be ordained and 
sent forth to preach the everlast- 
ing gospel among the nations — 

6. Crying repentance, saying: 
Save yourselves from this un- 
toward generation, and come 
forth out of the fire, hating even 
the garments spotted with the 
flesh.

shall be given unto the elders of 
my church, that c every man which 
will embrace it with singleness

1. Behold, I say unto you that 
it is not expedient in me that ye 
should translate any more until 
ye shall go to the Ohio, and this 
because of the enemy and for 
your sakes. 

2. And again, I say unto you 
that ye shall not go until ye have 
preached my gospel in those parts, 
and have strengthened up the 
church whithersoever it is found, 
and more especially in *Coles- 



ville; for, behold, they pray unto 
me in much faith. 

3. And again, a commandment 
I give unto the church, that it is 
expedient in me that they should 
'assemble together at the Ohio, 
against the time that my servant 
Oliver Cowdery shall return unto 
them. 

4. Behold, here is wisdom, and 
let every man choose for himself 
until I come. Even so. Amen.

I Am, Alpha and Omega, the be- 
ginning and the end, the same 
which looked upon the "wide ex- 
panse of eternity, and all the 
seraphic hosts of heaven, before 
the world was made; 

2. The same which 6 knoweth 
all things, for all things are 
'present before mine eyes; 

3. I am the same which spake, 



and the world was made, and all 
things came by me. 

4. I am the same which have 
taken the "Zion of Enoch into 
mine own bosom; and verily, I 
say, even as many as have be- 
lieved in my name, for I am 
Christ, and in mine own name, 
by the virtue of the blood which 
I have spilt, have I pleaded be-

the wicked have I kept in 'chains 
of darkness until the judgment 
of the great day, which shall come 
at the end of the earth; 

6. And even so 'will I cause 
the wicked to be kept, that will 
not hear my voice but harden 
their hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is 
their doom. 

7. But behold, verily, verily, I 
say unto you that mine eyes are 
upon you. I am in your midst 
and ye cannot see me; 

8. But the day soon cometh 
that ye shall see me, and know 
that I am; for the veil of dark- 
ness shall soon be "rent, and he 
that is not purified shall not abide 
the day. 

9. Wherefore, gird up your 
loins and be prepared. Behold, 
the 'kingdom is yours, and the 
enemy shall not overcome. 

10. Verily I say unto you, ye 
are clean, but not all; and there 
is none else with whom I am well 
pleased; 

11. For all flesh is corrupted 
before me; and the powers of 
darkness prevail upon the earth, 
among the children of men, in the 
presence of all the hosts of 
heaven — 

12. Which causeth 'silence to 
reign, and all 'eternity is pained, 
and the k angels are waiting the 
great command to reap down the 
earth, to gather the 'tares that 
they may be burned; and, behold, 
the enemy is combined. 

13. And now I show unto you 
a mystery* a thing which is had 
in secret chambers, to bring to 
pass even your destruction in 
process of time, and ye knew it 
not; 



14. But now I tell it unto you, 
and ye are blessed, not because 
of your iniquity, neither your 
hearts of unbelief; for verily some 
of you are guilty before me, but 
I will be merciful unto your weak- 
ness. 

15. Therefore, be ye strong 
from henceforth; fear not, for the 
"kingdom is yours. 

16. And for your salvation I 
give unto you a commandment, 
for I have heard your # prayers, 
and the poor have complained be- 
fore me, and the rich have I made, 
and all flesh is mine, and I am no 
"respecter of persons. 

17. And I have made the earth 
rich, and behold it is my foot- 
stool, wherefore, again I will 
stand upon it. 

18. And I hold forth and deign 
to give unto you greater riches, 
even a "land of promise, a land 
flowing with milk and honey, 
upon which there shall be no 
curse when the Lord cometh; 

19. And I will give it unto you 
for the land of your inheritance, 
if you seek it with all your hearts. 

20. And this shall be my cove- 
nant with you, ye shall have it 
for the land of your inheritance, 
and for the inheritance of your 
children forever, while the earth 
shall stand, and ye shall 'possess 
it again in eternity, no more to 
pass away. 

21. But, verily I say unto you 
that in time ye shall have no king 
nor ruler, for I will be your king 
and watch over you. 

22. Wherefore, hear my voice 
and follow me, and you shall be 
a free people, and ye shall have 
no laws but my laws when I come,

for I am your lawgiver, and what 
can stay my hand? 

23. But, verily I say unto you, 
teach one another according to 
the office wherewith I have ap- 
pointed you; 

24. And let every man esteem 
«his brother as himself, and prac- 
tise virtue and holiness before 
me. 

25. And again I say unto you, 
let every man esteem his brother 
as himself. 

26. For what man among you 
having twelve sons, and is no re- 
specter of them, and they serve 
him obediently, and he saith unto 
the one: Be thou clothed in robes 
and sit thou here; and to the 
other: Be thou clothed in rags 
and sit thou there — and looketh 
upon his sons and saith I am 
just? 

27. Behold, this I have given 
unto you as a parable, and it is 
even as I am. I say unto you, 
be one; and if ye are r not one ye 
are not mine. 

28. And again, I say unto you 
that the enemy in the 'secret 
chambers seeketh your lives. 

29. Ye hear of wars in far 
countries, and you say that there 
will soon be great wars in far 
countries, but ye know not the 
'hearts of men in your own land. 

30. I tell you these things be- 
cause of your prayers; where- 
fore, treasure up wisdom in your 
bosoms, lest the wickedness of 
men reveal these things unto you 
by their wickedness, in a manner 
which shall speak in your ears 
with a voice louder than that 
which shall shake the earth; but 
if ye are prepared ye shall not 
fear. 



31. And that ye might escape 
the power of the enemy, and be 
"gathered unto me a righteous 
people, without spot and blame- 
less — 

32. Wherefore, for this cause 
I gave unto you the command- 
ment that ye should "go to the 
Ohio; and there I will give unto 
you my "law; and there you shall 
be 'endowed with power from on 
high; 

33. And from thence, whoso- 
ever I will shall *go forth among 
all nations, and it shall be told 
them what they shall do; for I 
have a great work laid up in 
store, for Israel shall be saved, 
and I will lead them whitherso- 
ever I will, and no power shall 
stay my hand. 

34. And now, I give unto the 
church in these parts a command- 
ment, that certain men among 
them shall be appointed, and they 
shall be appointed by the voice 
of the church; 

35. And they shall look to the 
poor and the needy, and admin- 
ister to their relief that they shall 
not suffer; and send them forth 
to the place which I have com- 
manded them; 

36. And this shall be their 
work, to govern the affairs of the 
property of this church. 

37. And they that have farms 
that cannot be sold, let them be 
left or rented as seemeth them 
good. 

38. See that all things are pre- 
served; and when men are "en- 
dowed with power from on high 
and sent forth, all these things 
shall be gathered unto the bosom 
of the church. 

39. And if ye seek the riches

which it is the will of the Father 
to give unto you, ye shall be the 
richest of all people, for ye shall 
have the 2o riches of eternity; and 
it must needs be that the riches 
of the earth are mine to give; 
but beware of pride, lest ye 2 "be- 
come as the Nephites of old. 

40. And again, I say unto you, 
I give unto you a commandment, 
that every man, both elder, priest, 
teacher, and also member, go to 



with his might, with the labor 
of his hands, to prepare and ac- 
complish the things which I have 
commanded. 

41. And let your preaching be 
the warning voice, every man to 
his neighbor, in mildness and in 
meekness. 

42. And go ye out from among 
the wicked. Save yourselves. Be 
ye clean that bear the vessels of 
the Lord. Even so. Amen. 



SECTION 39. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to James 
Covill, at Fayette, New York, January 5, 1831. James Covill cove- 
nanted that he would obey any command that the Lord would give to 
him through Joseph the Prophet. See History of the Church, vol. 1, 

p. 143. The Lord Jesus Christ specifies the conditions under 

which men may become his sons — James Covill promised blessing beyond 
all he had ever known, conditioned on his obedience to the Lord y s com- 
mandments. 



1. Hearken and listen to the 
voice of him who is "from all 
eternity to all eternity, the Great 
I Am, even Jesus Christ — 

2. *The light and the life of 
the world ; a light which c shineth 
in darkness and the darkness 
comprehendeth it not; 

3. The same which came in the 
'meridian of time unto mine own, 
and mine own received me not; 

4. But to as many as received 
me, gave I 'power to become my 
sons; and even so will I give unto 
as many as will receive me, power 
to become my sons. 

5. And verily, verily, I say unto 
you, he that receiveth my gospel 
receiveth me; and he that receiv- 
eth not my gospel receiveth not 
me. 

6. And this is my gospel — 're- 
pentance and baptism by water, 



and then cometh the baptism of 
fire and the Holy Ghost, even the 
Comforter, which showeth all 
things, and teacheth the peace- 
able things of the kingdom. 

7.- And now, behold, I say unto 
you, my servant James, I have 
looked upon thy works and I 
know thee. 

8. And verily I say unto thee, 
thine heart is now right before 
me at this time; and, behold, I 
have bestowed great blessings 
upon thy head; 

9. Nevertheless, thou hast seen 
great sorrow, for thou hast re- 
jected me many times because of 
pride and the cares of the world. 

10. But, behold, the days of 
thy deliverance are come, if thou 
wilt hearken to my voice, which 
saith unto thee: Arise and be 
'baptized, and wash away your

sins, calling on my name, and 
you shall receive my Spirit, and 
a blessing so great as you never 
have known. 

11. And if thou do this, I have 
prepared thee for a greater work. 
Thou shalt preach the ^fulness of 
my gospel, which I have sent 
forth in these last days, the 
'covenant which I have sent forth 
to recover my people, which are 
of the house of Israel. 

12. And it shall come to pass 
that power shall rest upon thee; 
thou shalt have great faith, and 
I will be with thee and go before 
thy face. 

13. Thou art called to labor 
in my vineyard, and to build up 
'my church, and to bring forth 
*Zion, that it may rejoice upon 
the 'hills and flourish. 

14. Behold, verily, verily, I say 
unto thee, thou art not called to 
go into the eastern countries, but 
thou art called to go to the Ohio. 

15. And inasmuch as my peo- 
ple shall assemble themselves at 
the Ohio, I have kept in store a 
blessing such as is not known 
among the children of men, and 
it shall be poured forth upon 
their heads. And from thence 
men shall m go forth into all na- 
tions. 

16. Behold, verily, verily, I 
say unto you, that the people in 
Ohio call upon me in much faith, 
thinking I will stay my hand in 



judgment upon the nations, but 
I cannot deny my word. 

17. Wherefore lay to with your 
might and call "faithful laborers 
into my vineyard, that it may be 
pruned for the last time. 

18. And inasmuch as they do 
repent and receive the "fulness of 
my gospel, and become sanctified, 
I will stay mine hand in judg- 
ment. 

19. Wherefore, go forth, cry- 
ing with a loud voice, saying: 
The kingdom of heaven is at 
hand; crying: Hosanna! blessed 
be the name of the Most High 
God. 

20. Go forth baptizing with 
water, 'preparing the way before 
my face for the time of my com- 
ing; 

21. For the time is at hand; 
the «day or the hour no man 
knoweth; but it surely shall come. 

22. And he that receiveth 
these things receiveth me; and 
they shall be 'gathered unto me 
in time and in eternity. 

23. And again, it shall come to 
pass that on as many as ye shall 
baptize with water, ye shall 'lay 
your hands, and they shall re- 
ceive the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
and shall be looking forth for the 
signs of my coming, and shall 
know me. 

24. Behold, I 'come quickly. 
Even so. Amen.

gave unto me and Sidney Big don the following revelation : 



1. Behold, verily I say unto 
jrou,- that the heart of my ser- 
vant James Covill was right be- 
fore me, for he covenanted with 
oie that he would obey my word. 

2. And he received the word 
with gladness, but straightway 
Satan tempted him; and the fear 



of persecution and the cares of 
the world caused him to reject

3. Wherefore he broke my 
covenant, and it remaineth with 
me to do with him as seemeth 
me good. Amen. 



SECTION 41. 



ReveIiAtion given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to the Church, 
at Kirtland, Ohio, February 4, 1831. The Kirtland branch of the 
Church at this time was rapidly increasing in numbers, and the Saints 
generally were striving to live according to the commandments of the 
Lord; but, the Prophet states, some, strange notions and false spirits 
had crept in among them. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 

146. Commandment regarding the observance of the law of the 

Lord — Promise of greater knowledge as to the government of the 
Church — Edward Partridge named as the first Bishop unto the Church. 



1. Hearken and hear, O ye my 
people, saith the Lord and your 
God, ye whom I delight to bless 
with the greatest of all blessings, 
ye that hear me; and ye that hear 
me not will I curse, that have 
professed my name, with the 
"heaviest of all cursings. 

2. Hearken, O ye elders of my 
church whom I have called, be- 
hold I give unto you a command- 
ment, that ye shall assemble your- 
selves together to agree upon my 
word; 

3. And by the prayer of your 
faith ye shall receive my 6 law, 
that ye may know how to govern 
my church and have all things 
right before me. 

4. And I will be your ruler 
when I come; and behold, I 'come 
quickly, and ye shall see that my 
law is kept. 

5. He that receiveth my d law 



and doeth it, the same is my 
disciple; and he that saith he 
receiveth it and doeth it not, the 
same is not my disciple, and shall 
be cast out from among you; 

6. For it is not meet that the 
things which belong to the chil- 
dren of the kingdom should be 
given to them that are not worthy, 
or to dogs, or the pearls to be 
cast before swine. 

7. And again, it is meet that 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., 
should have a house built, in 
which to live and translate. 

8. And again, it is meet that 
my servant Sidney Rigdon should 
live as seemeth him good, inas- 
much as he keepeth my command-

servant Edward Partridge; and I

The Prophet specifies this revelation as embracing the law of the 

Church. Elders commanded to go forth two by two westward, 

preaching and baptizing, according to the Bible and the Book of Mor- 
mon, and according to the latter-day revelations already given and to 
be given — Several commandments comprised in the decalog reiterated— 
Church members who commit crimes to be handed over to the law of 
the land — Members required to impart of their substance for the needs 
of the poor and the building up of the Church — Site of the New 
Jerusa 7 em to be revealed later — Pride of heart and costly apparel 
forbidden — The idler denounced — Administration to the afflicted by 
the laying on of hands of the Elders — Comforting assurance concerning 
those who die in the Lord — Sexual sin proclaimed against — The funda- 
mental principles of Church discipline. 

1. Hearken, O ye elders of my 
church, who have assembled your- 
selves together in my name, even 
Jesus Christ the Son of the liv- 
ing God, the Savior of the world; 
Inasmuch as ye believe on my 
name and keep my command- 
ments. 

2. Again I say unto you, heark- 
en and hear and obey the 'law 
which I shall give unto you. 

3. For verily I say, as ye have 
assembled yourselves together 
according to the commandment 
wherewith I commanded you, and 
are agreed as touching this one 
thing, and have asked the Father 



in my name, even so ye shall re- 
ceive. 

4. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, I give unto you this first 
commandment, that ye shall go 
forth in my name, every one of 
you, excepting my servants Jo- 
seph Smith, Jun., and Sidney 
Rigdon. 

5. And I give unto them a 
commandment that they shall go 
forth for a little season, and it 
shall be given by the power of 
the Spirit when they shall return. 

6. And ye shall go forth in the 
power of my Spirit, preaching my 
gospel, two by two, in my name,

lifting up your voices as with the 
sound of a trump, declaring my 
word like unto angels of God. 

7. And ye shall go forth bap- 
tizing with water, saying: *Re- 
pent ye, repent ye, for the king- 
dom of heaven is at hand. 

8. And from this place ye shall 
go forth into the regions west- 
ward; and inasmuch as ye shall 
find them that will receive you 
ye shall build up r my church in 
every region — 

9. Until the time shall come 
when it shall be revealed unto 
you from on high, when the city 
of the 'New Jerusalem shall be 
prepared, that ye may be gathered 
in one, that ye may be my people 
and I will be your God. 

10. And again, I say unto you, 
that my servant Edward Part- 
ridge shall stand in the office 
whereunto I have appointed him. 
And it shall come to pass, that if 
he transgress another shall be ap- 
pointed in his stead. Even so. 
Amen. 

11. Again, I say unto you, that 
it shall not be given to any one 
to go forth to preach my gospel, 
or to build up my church, except 
he be ordained by some one who 
has authority, and it is known to 
the church that he has authority 
and has been regularly ordained 
by the heads of the church. 

12. And again, the elders, 
priests and teachers of this church 
shall teach the principles of my 
gospel, which are in the Bible 
and the Book of Mormon, in the 
which is the "fulness of the gos- 
pel. 

13. And they shall observe the 



covenants and church articles to 
do them, and these shall be their 
teachings, as they shall be di- 
rected by the Spirit. 

14. And the Spirit shall be 
given unto you by the prayer of 
faith; and if ye 'receive not the 
Spirit ye shall not teach. 

15. And all this ye shall ob- 
serve to do as I have commanded 
concerning your teaching, until 
the 'fulness of my scriptures is 
given. 

16. And as ye shall lift up your 
voices by the Comforter, ye shall 
speak and prophesy as seemeth 
me good; 

17. For, behold, the *Com- 
forter knoweth all things, and 
'beareth^record of the Father and 
of the Son. 

18. And now, behold, I speak 
unto the church. Thou shalt not 
kill; and he that kills shall 'not 
have forgiveness in this world, 
nor in the world to come. 

19. And again, I say, thou 
shalt not kill; but he that killeth 
shall die. 

20. Thou shalt not steal; and 
he that stealeth and will not re- 
pent shall be cast out. 

21. Thou shalt not lie; he 
that lieth and will not repent 
shall be cast out. 

22. Thou shalt love thy *wife 
with all thy heart, and shalt 
cleave unto her and none else. 

23. And he that looketh upon 
a woman 'to lust after her shall 
deny the faith, and shall not have 
the Spirit; and if he repents not 
he shall be cast out. 

24. Thou shalt m not commit 
adultery; and he that committeth

adultery, and repenteth not, shall 
be cast out. 

25. But he that has committed 
adultery and repents with all his 
heart, and f orsaketh it, and doeth 
it no more, thou shalt forgive; 

26. But if he doeth it again, 
he shall not be forgiven, but 
shall be cast out. 

27. Thou shalt not speak evil 
of thy neighbor, nor do him any 
harm. 

28. Thou knowest my laws 
concerning these things are given 
in my scriptures; he that sinneth 
and repenteth not shall be cast 
out. 

29. If thou lovest me thou 
shalt serve me and keep all my 
commandments. 

30. And behold, thou wilt re- 
member the poor, and "consecrate 
of thy properties for their sup- 
port that which thou hast to im- 
part unto them, with a covenant 
and a deed which cannot be 
broken. 

31. And inasmuch as ye im- 
part of your substance unto the 
poor, ye will do it unto me; and 
they shall be laid before the 
bishop of my church and his 
counselors, two of the elders, or 
high priests, such as he shall ap- 
point or has appointed and set 
apart for that purpose. 

32. And it shall come to pass, 
that after they are laid before the 
bishop of my church, and after 
that he has received these testi- 
monies concerning the consecra- 
tion of the properties of my 
church, that they cannot be taken 
from the church, agreeable to my 
commandments, every man shall 
be made accountable unto me, a 
•steward over his own property, 
or that which he has received by 



consecration, as much as is suffi- 
cient for himself and family. 

33. And again, if there shall 
be properties in the hands of the 
church, or any individuals of it, 
more than is necessary for their 
support after this first consecra- 
tion, which is a residue to be con- 
secrated unto the bishop, it shall 
be kept to administer to those 
who have not, from time to time, 
that every man who has need may 
be amply supplied and receive ac- 
cording to his wants. 

34. Therefore, the residue 
shall be kept in my storehouse, 
to administer to the poor and the 
needy, as shall be appointed by 
the 'high council of the church, 
and the bishop and his council; 

35. And for the purpose of 
purchasing lands for the public 
benefit of the church, and build- 
ing houses of worship, and build- 
ing up of the *New Jerusalem 
which is hereafter to be re- 
vealed — 

36. That my 'covenant people 
may be gathered in one in that 
day when I shall 'come to my 
temple. And this I do for the 
salvation of my people. 

37. And it shall come to pass, 
that he that sinneth and repent- 
eth not shall be cast out of the 
church, and shall not receive 
again that which he has conse- 
crated unto the poor and the 
needy of my church, or in other 
words, unto me — 



38. For inasmuch]! 
unto the least of thi

among the Gentiles unto tlie poor 
of my people who are of the 
house of Israel. 

40. And again, thou shalt not 
be proud In thy heart; let all thy 
'garments be plain, and their 
beauty the beauty of the work of 
thine own hands; 

41. And let all things be done 
In cleanliness before me. 

42. Thou shalt "not be idle; for 
lie that la idle shall not eat the 
bread nor wear the garments of 
the laborer. 

43. And whosoever among you 
'are sick, and have not faith to 
be healed, but believe, shall be 
nourished with all tenderness, 
with herbs and mild food, and 
that not by the hand of an enemy. 

44. And the elders of the 
church, two or more, shall be 
called, and shall pray for and 
lay their hands upon them in my 
name; and if they die they shall 
die unto me, and if tbey live they 
shall live unto me. 

46. Thou shalt live together in 
love, insomuch that "thou shalt 
weep for the loss of them that 
die, and more especially for those 
that have not hope of a glorious 
resurrection. 

46. And it shall come to pass 
that those that die in me shall 
'not taste of death, for it shall be 
sweet unto them; 

47. And they that die not in 
me. "wo unto them, for their 
death is bitter. 

48. And again, it shall come to 
pass that he that hath 'faith In 
me to be healed, and Is not ap- 
pointed unto death, shall be 
healed. 

49. He who hath faith to see 



50. He who hath faith to hear 
shall hear. 

61. The lame who hath faith 
to leap shall leap. 

52. And they who have not 
faith to do these things, but be- 
lieve in me, have power to be- 
come my sons; and inasmuch as 
they break not my laws thou shalt 
bear their infirmities. 

53. Thou sbalt stand In the 
place of thy stewardship. 

54. Thou shalt not take thy 
brother's garment; thou sbalt 
-"pay for that which thou shalt 
receive of thy brother. 

55. And if thou obtalnest 
"more than that which would be 
for thy support, thou shait give 
it into my storehouse, that all 
things may be done according to 
that which 1 have said. 

56. Thou shalt ask, and my 
;r scriptures shall be given as I 
have appointed, and they shall be 
preserved in safety; 

57. And it is expedient that 
thou shouldst hold thy peace con- 
cerning them, and not teach theni 
until ye have received them in 
full. 

58. And I give unto you a 
commandment that then ye shall 
teach them unto all men; for 
-'they shall be taught unto all 
nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people. 

59. Thou shalt take the things 
which thou hast received, which 
have been given unto thee in my 
scriptures for a law, to be my law 
to govern my church; 

60. And he that doeth accord- 
ing to these things shall be saved, 
and he that doeth them not shall 
be damned If he so continue.

61. If thou shalt ask, 2e thou 
shalt receive revelation upon reve- 
lation, knowledge upon knowl- 
edge, that thou mayest know the 
mysteries and peaceable things — 
that which bringeth joy, that 
which bringeth life eternal. 

62. Thou shalt ask, and it shall 
be revealed unto you in mine own 
due time 2r where the New Jeru- 
salem shall be built. 

63. And behold, it shall come 
to pass that my servants shall be 
sent forth to the east and to the 
west, to the north and to the 
south. 

64. And even now, let him that 
goeth to the east teach them that 
shall be converted to flee to the 
west, and this in consequence of 
that which is coming on the 
earth," and of 2 'secret combina- 
tions. 

65. Behold, thou shalt observe 
all these things, and great shall 
be thy reward; for unto you it is 
given to 2fc know the mysteries of 
the kingdom, but unto the world 
it is not given to know them. 

66. Ye shall observe the laws 
• which ye have received and be 

faithful. 

67. And ye shall hereafter re- 
ceive 2&lt; church covenants, such as 
shall be sufficient to establish 
you, both here and in the New 
Jerusalem. 

68. Therefore, 2 *he that lack- 
eth wisdom, let him ask of me, 
and I will give him liberally and 
upbraid him not. 

69. Lift up your hearts and 
rejoice, for unto you the ^king- 
dom, or in other words, the keys 
of the church have been given. 
Even so. Amen. 

70. The priests and teachers 



shall have their stewardships, 
even as the members. 

71. And the elders or high 
priests who are appointed to as- 
sist the bishop as counselors in 
all things, are to have their fam- 
ilies supported out of the prop- 
erty which is consecrated to the 
bishop, for the good of the poor, 
and for other purposes, as be- 
fore mentioned; 

72. Or they are to receive a 
just remuneration for all their 
services, either* a stewardship or 
otherwise, as may be thought 
best or decided by the counselors 
and bishop. 

, 73. And the bishop, also, shall 
receive his support, or a just re- 
muneration for all his services 
in the church. 

74. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, that whatever persons among 
you, having put away their com- 
panions for the 2 *cause of fornica- 
tion, or in other words, if they 
shall testify before you in all low- 
liness of heart that this is the 
case, ye shall not cast them out 
from among you; 

75. But if ye shall find that 
any persons have left their com- 
panions for the 2l sake of adultery, 
and they themselves are the of- 
fenders, and their companions are 
living, they shall be cast out from 
among you. 

76. And again, I say unto you, 
that ye shall be watchful and 
careful, with all inquiry, that ye 
receive none such among you if 
they are married; 

77. And if they are not mar- 
ried, they shall repent of all their 
sins or ye shall not receive them. 

78. And again, every person 
who belongeth to this church of 
Christ, shall observe to keep all

the commandments and cove- 
nants of the church. 

79. And it shall come to pass, 
that if any persons among you 
shall kill they shall be delivered 
up and dealt with according to 
the laws of the land; for remem- 
ber that he hath 2m no forgive- 
ness; and it shall be proved 
according to the laws of the 
land. 

80. And if any man or woman 
shall 2n commit adultery, he or she 
shall be tried before two elders 
of the church, or more, and every 
word shall be established against 
him or her by two witnesses of 
the church, and not of the enemy; 
but if there are more than two 
witnesses it is better. 

81. But he or she shall be con- 
demned by the mouth of two wit- 
nesses; and the elders shall lay 
the case before the church, and 
the church shall lift up their 
hands against him or her, that 
they may be dealt with according 
to the law of God. 

82. And if it can be, it is neces- 
sary that the bishop be present 
also. 

83. And thus ye shall do in all 
cases which shall come before 
you. 

84. And if a man or woman 
shall rob, he or she shall be de- 
livered up unto the law of the 
land. 

85. And if he or she shall steal, 



he or she shall be delivered up 
unto the law of the land. 

86. And if he or she shall lie, 
he or she shall be delivered up 
unto the law of the land. 

87. And if he or she do 2o any 
manner of iniquity, he or she 
shall be delivered up unto the 
law, even that of God. 

88. And if thy brother or sis- 
ter 2p offend thee, thou shalt take 
him or her between him or her 
and thee alone; and if he or she 
confess thou shalt be reconciled. 

89. And if he or she confess 
not thou shalt deliver him or her 
up unto the church, not to the 
members, but to the elders. And 
it shall be done in a meeting, and 
that not before the world. 

90. And if thy brother or. sister 
offend many, he or she shall be 
chastened before many. 

91. And if any one offend 
openly, he or she shall be re- 
buked openly, that he or she may 
be ashamed. And if he or she 
confess not, he or she shall be 
delivered up unto the law of God. 

92. If any shall offend in secret, 
he or she shall be rebuked in 
secret, that he or she may have 
opportunity to confess in secret 
to him or her whom he or she 
has offended, and to God, that 
the church may not speak re- 
proachfully of him or her. 

93. And thus shall ye conduct 
in all things.

teach according to the spirit of revelation and not to be taught in the 
precepts of men — Assurances of the Lord's future advent— Calamities

1. O hearken, ye elders of my ; 
church* and give ear to the words 
which I shall speak unto yon. 

2. For behold, verily, verily, I 
say unto yon, that ye have re- 
ceived a commandment for a "law 
unto my church, through him 
whom I have appointed nnto you 
to receive commandments and 
revelations from my hand. 

3. And this ye shall know as- 
suredly — that there is *none other 
appointed unto you to receive 
commandments and revelations 
until he be taken, if he abide in 
me. 

4. But verily, verily, I say unto 
you, that none else shall be ap- 
pointed unto this gift except it 
be through him ; for if it be taken 
from him he shall not have power 
except to appoint another in his 
stead. 

5. And this shall be a law unto 
you, that ye receive not the teach- 
ings of any that shall come be- 
fore you as revelations or com- 
mandments; 

6. And this I give unto you 
that you may not be deceived, 
that you may know they are not 
of me. 

7. For verily I say unto you, 
that he that is 'ordained of me 
shall come in at the gate and be 
ordained as I have told you be- 
fore, to teach those revelations 
which you have received and 
shall receive through him whom 
I have appointed. 

8. And now, behold, I give 
unto you a commandment, that 
when ye are assembled together 
ye shall instruct and edify each 



other, that ye may know how to 
act and direct my church, how to 
act upon the points of my law 
and commandments, which I have 
given. 

9. And thus ye shall become 
instructed in the law of my 
church, and be sanctified by that 
which ye have received, and ye 
shall 'bind yourselves to act in 
all holiness before me — 

10. That inasmuch as ye do 
this, glory shall be added to the 
kingdom which ye have received. 
Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall 
be taken, even that which ye 
have received. 

11. Purge ye out the iniquity 
which is among you; sanctify 
yourselves before me; 

12. And if ye desire the glories 
of the kingdom, appoint ye my 
servant Joseph Smith, Jan., and 
uphold him before me by the 
prayer of faith. 

13. And again, I say unto yon, 
that if ye desire the mysteries of 
the kingdom, provide for him 
food and raiment, and whatso- 
ever thing he needeth to accom- 
plish the work wherewith I have 
commanded him; 

14. And if ye do it not he shall 
remain unto them that have re- 
ceived him, that I may reserve 
unto myself a pure people before 
me. 

15. Again* I say, hearken ye 
elders of my church, whom I have 
appointed: Ye are not sent forth 
to be taught, but to teach the 
children of men the things which 
I have put into your hands by 
the power of my Spirit;

16. And ye 'are to be taught 
from on high. Sanctity your- 
selves and ye shall be 'endowed 
with power, that ye may give even 
as I have spoken. 

17. Hearken ye, for, behold, 
the great day o( the Lord is nigh 
at hand. 

IB. For the day cometh that 
the Lord shall "utter his voice 
out of heaven; the heavens shall 
'shake and the earth shall trem- 
ble, and the 'trump of God shall 
sound both long and loud, and 
shall say to the sleeping nations: 
Ye saints arise and live; ye sin- 
ners stay and sleep until I shall 
call again. 

19. Wherefore gird up your 
loins lest ye be found among the 
wicked. 

20. Lift up your voices and 
spare not. Call upon the 'na- 
tions to repent, both old and 
young, both bond and free, say- 
ing: Prepare yourselves for the 
great day of the Lord; 

21. For if I, who am a man, do 
lift up my voice and call upon you 
to repent, and ye hate me, what 
will ye say when the day cometh 
when the thunders shall utter 
their voices from the ends of the

24. O, ye nations of the earth, 
how often would I have "gathered 
you together as a hen gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, 
but ye would not! 

25. How oft have I called upon 
you by the mouth of my servants, 
and by the ministering of angels, 
and by mine own voice, and by 
the "voice of thunderings, and by 
the voice of lightnings, and by 
the voice of tempests, and by the 
voice of earthquakes, and great 
hailstorms, and by the voice of 
famines and pestilences of every 
kind, and by the great sound of 
a trump, and by the voice of 
Judgment, and by the voice of 
mercy all the day long, and by 
the voice of glory and honor and 
the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with an 
everlasting salvation, but ye 
would not! 

26. Behold the day has come, 
when the cup of the wrath of 
mine indignation is full,

you, that these are the words of 
the Lord your God. 

28. Wherefore, labor ye, 'labor 
ye in my vineyard for the last 
time — for the last time call upon 
the inhabitants of the earth.

will I come upon the earth In 
Judgment, and my people shall be 
redeemed and shall "reign with

mouth of my servants, shall come.

and when he is loosed again he 
shall only reign for a 'little sea-

of the earth. 

32. And he that liveth in right- 
eousness shall be v changed in the 
twinkling of an eye, and the

fire. 

33. And the wicked shall go 
away into 'unquenchable fire, and 



their end no man knoweth on 
earth, nor ever shall know, until 
they come before me in judgment.

Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the

these things up in your hearts, 
and let the Solemnities of eter- 
nity rest upon your minds.

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rig don, 
at Kirtland, Ohio, in the latter part of February, 1831. In com- 
pliance with the requirement herein set forth the Church appointed a 

conference to be held early in the month of June following. The 

Elders to assemble to receive further instruction — To organize accord- 
ing to the laws of th&amp; land, thus strengthening themselves against the 
machinations of their opponents. 



1. Behold, thus saith the Lord 
unto you my servants, it is ex- 
pedient in me that the elders of 
my church should be called to- 
gether, from the east and from 
the west, and from the north and 
from the south, by letter or some 
other way. 

2. And it shall come to pass, 
that inasmuch as they are faith- 
ful, and exercise faith in me, I 
will pour out my Spirit upon them 
in the day that they assemble 
themselves together. 

3. And it shall come to pass 
that they shall go forth into the 
regions round about, and preach 
repentance unto the people. 



4. And many shall be con- 
verted, insomuch that ye shall ob- 
tain power to organize yourselves 
"according to the laws of man; 

5. That your enemies may not 
have power over you; that you 
may be preserved in all things; 
that you may be enabled to keep 
my laws; that every bond may 
be broken wherewith the enemy 
seeketh to destroy my people. 

6. Behold, I say unto you, that 
ye must visit the poor and the 
needy and administer to their re- 
lief, that they may be kept until 
all things may be done accord- 
ing to my "law which ye have 
received. Amen.

1. Hearken, ye people of 
my church, to whom the "kingdom 
has been given; hearken ye and 
give ear to him who laid the 
Foundation of the earth, who 
made the heavens and all the 
hosts thereof, and by whom all 
things were made which live, and 
move, and have a being. 

2. And again I say, hearken 
unto my voice, lest death shall 
overtake you; in an hour when 
ye think not the 'summer shall be 
past, and the harvest ended, and 
your souls not saved. 

3. Listen to him who is the 
•advocate with the Father, who is 
pleading your cause before him — 

4. Saying: Father, behold the 
sufferings and death of him who 
did no sin, in whom thou wast 
well pleased; behold the blood of 
thy Son which was shed, the blood 
of him whom thou gavest that 
thyself might be glorified; 

5. Wherefore, Father, spare 
these my brethren that believe on 
my name, that they may come 
unto me and have everlasting 
life. 

6. Hearken, O ye people of my 
church, and ye elders listen to- 
gether, and hear my voice while 



it is called today, and harden 
not your hearts; 

7. For verily I say unto you 
that I am Alpha and Omega, the 
beginning and the end, the "light 
and the life of the world — a light 
that 'shlneth in darkness and the 
darkness comprehendeth it not. 

8. I came unto 'mine own, and 
mine own received me not; but 
unto as many as received me gave 
I "power to do many miracles, 
and to become the sons of God; 
and even unto them that believed 
on my name gave I power to ob- 
tain eternal life. 

9. And even so I have sent 
mine "everlasting covenant into 
the world, to be a light to the 
world, and to be a 'standard for 
my people, and for the Gentiles 
to seek to it, and to be a ■'mes- 
senger before my face to prepare 
the way before me. 

10. Wherefore, come ye unto 
it, and with him that cometh I 
will reason as with men in days 
of old, and I will show unto you 
my strong reasoning. 

11. Wherefore, hearken ye to- 
gether and let me show unto you 
even my wisdom — the wisdom of

him whom ye say is the God of 
Enoch, and his brethren, 

12. Who were 'separated from 
the earth, and were received unto 
myself — a city reserved until a 
day of righteousness shall come — 
a day which was sought for by 
all holy men, and they found it 
not because of wickedness and 
abominations; 

13. And confessed they were 
strangers and pilgrims on the 
earth; 

14. But obtained a promise 
that they should find it and see 
it in their flesh. 

15. Wherefore, hearken and I 
will reason with you, and I will 
speak unto you and prophesy, as 
unto men in days of old. 

16. And I will show it plainly 
as I showed it unto my disciples 
as I stood before them in the 
flesh, and spake unto them, say- 
ing: As ye have asked of me con- 
cerning the signs of my coming, 
in the day when I shall come in 
my glory in the clouds of heaven, 
to fulfil the promises that I have 
made unto your fathers, 

17. For as ye have looked upon 
the long absence of your spirits 
from your bodies to be a bondage, 
I will show unto you how the day 
of redemption shall come, and 
also the 'restoration of the scat- 
tered Israel. 

18. And now ye behold this 
temple which is in Jerusalem, 
which ye call the house of God, 
and your enemies say that this 
house shall never fall. 

19. But, verily I say unto you, 
that desolation shall come upon 
this generation as a thief in the 
night, and this people shall be 
•"destroyed and scattered among 
all nations. 



20. And this temple which ye 
now see shall be thrown down 
that there shall not be left "one 
stone upon another. 

21. And it shall come to pass, 
that this generation of Jews shall 
not pass away until every desola- 
tion which I have told you con- 
cerning them shall come to pass. 

22. Ye say that ye know that 
the end of the world cometh; ye 
say also that ye know that the 
heavens and the earth shall pass 
away; 

23. And in this ye say truly, 
for so it is; but these things 
which I have told you shall not 
pass away until all shall be ful- 
filled. 

24. And this I have told you 
concerning Jerusalem; and when 
that day shall come, shall a rem- 
nant be scattered among all na- 
tions; 

25. But they shall be gathered 
again ; but they shall remain until 
the °time8 of the Gentiles be ful- 
filled. 

26. And in that day shall be 
heard of wars and rumors of 
wars, and the 'whole earth shall 
be in commotion, and men's 
hearts shall fail them, and they 
shall say that Christ delayeth his 
coming until the end of the earth. 

27. And the love of men shall 
wax cold, and iniquity shall 
abound. 

28. And when the times of the 
Gentiles is come in, a *light shall 
break forth among them that sit 
in darkness, and it shall be the 
tulness of my gospel; 

29. But they receive it not; 
for they perceive not the light, 
and they turn their hearts from 
me because of the precepts of 
men.

30. And in that 'generation 
shall the times of the Qentiles 
be fulfilled. 

31. And there shall be 'men 
standing in that generation, that 
shall not pass until they shall 
see an overflowing scourge; for 
i "desolating sickness shall cover 
;he land. 

32. But my disciples 'shall 
stand in holy places, and shall 
lot be moved; but among the 
wicked, men shall lift up their 
roices and "curse Qod and die. 

33. And there shall be *earth- 
luakes also in divers places, and 
many desolations; yet men will 
harden their hearts against me, 
and they will "take up the sword, 
3ne against another, and they will 
kill one another. 

34. And now, when I the Lord 
had spoken these words unto my 
disciples, they were troubled. 

35. And I said unto them: Be 
not troubled, for, when all these 
things shall come to pass, ye may 
know that the promises which 
have been made unto you shall 
be fulfilled. 

36. And when the light shall 
'begin to break forth, it shall be 
with them like unto a parable 
which I will show you — 

37. Ye look and behold the fig- 
trees, and ye see them with your 
eyes, and ye say when they begin 
to shoot forth, and their leaves 
are yet tender, that summer is 
now nigh at hand; 

38. Even so it shall be in that 
day when they shall see all these 
things, then shall they 2a know 
that the hour is nigh. 

39. And it shall come to pass 



that he that feareth me shall be 
looking forth for the great day 
of the Lord to come, even for the 
2 "signs of the coming of the Son 
of Man. 

40. And they shall 2c see signs 
and wonders, for they shall be 
shown forth in the heavens above, 
and in the earth beneath. 

41. And they shall behold 
blood, and fire, and vapors of 
smoke. 

42. And before the day of the 
Lord shall come, the "sun shall 
be darkened, and the moon be 
turned into blood, and the stars 
fall from heaven. 

43. And the remnant shall be 
2e gathered unto this place; 

44. And then they shall look 
for me, and, behold, I will come; 
and *'they shall see me in the 
clouds of heaven, clothed with 
power and great glory, with all 
the holy angels; and he that 
watches not for me shall be cut 
off. 

45. But before the arm of the 
Lord shall fall, an 2 "angel shall 
sound his trump, and the saints 
that have slept shall come forth 
to "meet me in the cloud. 

46. Wherefore, if ye have slept 
in peace blessed are you; for as 
you now behold me and know 
that I am, even so shall ye come 
unto me and your souls shall live, 
and your redemption shall be per- 
fected; and the 2&lt; saints shall come 
forth from the four quarters of 
the earth. 

47. Then shall the 2 &gt;arm of the 
Lord fall upon the nations.

set his "foot upon this mount,

and it shall cleave in twain, and 
the earth shall 2I tremble, and reel 
to and fro, and the ""heavens also 
shall shake. 

49. And the Lord shall 2n utter 
his voice, and all the ends of the 
earth shall hear it; and the ^na- 
tions of the earth shall mourn, 
and they that have laughed shall 
see their folly. 

50. And calamity shall cover 
the mocker, and the scorner shall 
be consumed ; and they that have 
watched for iniquity shall be 
hewn down and cast into the fire. 

51. And then shall the Jews 
look upon me and say: 2p What 
are these wounds in thine hands 
and in thy feet? 

52. Then shall they know that 
I am the Lord ; for I will say unto 
them: These wounds are the 
wounds with which I was wound- 
ed in the house of my friends. 
I am he who was lifted up. I 
am Jesus that was crucified. I 
am the Son of God. 

53. And then shall 2 «they weep 
because of their iniquities; then 
shall they lament because they 
persecuted their king. 

54. And then shall the ^heath- 
en nations be redeemed, and they 
that knew no law shall have 2 *part 
in the first resurrection; and it 
shall be tolerable for them. 

55. And 2t Satan shall be bound, 
that he shall have no place in the 
hearts of the children of men. 

56. And at that day, when I 
shall come in my glory, shall the 
parable be fulfilled which I spake 
concerning the 2u ten virgins. 

57. For they that are wise and 
have received the truth, and have 
taken the Holy Spirit for their 
guide, and have not been de- 



ceived — verily I say unto you, 
they shall not be hewn down and 
cast into the fire, but shall abide 
the day. 

58. And the earth shall be 
given unto them for an inheri- 
tance; and they shall 2 *multiply 
and wax strong, and their chil- 
dren shall grow up without sin 
unto salvation. 

59. For the Lord shall be 2 *in 
their midst, and his glory shall 
be upon them, and he will be their 
king and their lawgiver. 

60. And now, behold, I say unto 
you, it shall not be given unto yon 
to know any further concerning 
this chapter, until the New Testa- 
ment be ^translated, and in it all 
these things shall be made known; 

61. Wherefore I give unto you 
that ye may now translate it, that 
ye may be prepared for the things 
to come. 

62. For verily I say unto you, 
that great things await you;

lands; but, behold, I say unto you, 
they are nigh, even at your doors, 
and not 2v many years hence ye

of my church from the beginning, 
and ever shall be, to "conduct all 
meetings as they are directed and 
guided by the Holy Spirit. 

3. Nevertheless ye are com- 
manded never to cast any one out 
from your public meetings, which 
are held before the world. 

i. Ye are also commanded not 
to cast any one who belongeth to 
the churcb out of your sacrament 
meetings; nevertheless, if any 
have trespassed, 'let him not par- 
take until he makes reconcilia- 
tion. 

5. And again I say unto you, 
ye shall not cast any out of your 
sacrament meetings who are ear- 
nestly seeking the kingdom — I 
speak this concerning those who 
are not of the church. 

6. And again I say unto you, 
concerning your r conflrmation 
meetings, that if there be any 
that are not of the church, that 
are earnestly seeking after the 
kingdom, ye shall not cast them 
out. 

7. But ye are commanded In 
all things to ask of God, who 
gtveth liberally; and that which 
the Spirit testifies unto you even 
ao I would that ye should do in 
all holiness of heart, walking up- 
rightly before me, considering the 
end of your salvation, doing all 
things with prayer and thanks- 
giving, that ye may not be se- 
duced by evil spirits, or doctrines 
of devils, or the commandments

S. Wherefore, beware lest ye le 
are deceived; and that ye may t: 
not be deceived 'seek ye earnestly 
the best gifts, always remember- z 
ing for what they are given; i 

9. For verily I say unto you, n 
they are given for the benefit ol 
those who love me and keep all « 
my commandments, and him that g 
seeketh so to do; that all may be u 
benefited that seek or that ask 
of me, that ask and not for a £ 
sign that they may consume ii 
upon their lusts. t&gt; 

10. And again, verily I say 
unto .you, I would that ye should ■• 
always remember, and always re- 
tain in your minds 'what those t 
gifts are, that are given unto the 
church. ; 

11. For all have not every gilt 
given unto them; for there are i 
many gifts, and to 'every man Is 
given a gift by the Spirit of God. &lt; 

12. To some Is given one, and 
to some is given another, that all &lt; 
may be profited thereby. 

13. To some it is given by the 
Holy Ghost to 'know that Jesni , 
Christ Is the Son of God, and that I 
he was crucified for the sins ol &lt; 
the world. 

14. To others It is given to be- 
lieve on their words, that they 
also might have eternal life If 
they continue faithful. 

15. And again, to some it Is 
given by the Holy Ghost to know 
the differences of administration, 
as It will be pleasing unto the 
same Lord, according as the Lord 
will, suiting his mercies according 
to the conditions of the children 
of men.

-whether they be of God, that the 
manifestations of the Spirit may 
be given to every man to profit 
withal. 

17. And again, verily I say 
unto you, to some is given, by 
the Spirit of God, the word of 
wisdom. 

18. To another is given the 
word of knowledge, that all may 
be taught to be wise and to have 
knowledge. 

19. And again, to some it is 
given to have faith to be healed; 

20. And to others it is given 
to have faith to heal. 

21. And again, to some is given 
the working of miracles; 

22. And to others it is given 
to prophesy; 

23. And to others the discern- 
ing of spirits. 

24. And again, it is given to 
some to speak with tongues; 

25. And to another is given the 
interpretation of tongues. 

26. And all these gifts eome 
from God, for the benefit of the 
children of God. 

27. And unto the bishop of the 
church, and unto such as God 



shall appoint and ordain to watch 
over the church and to be elders 
unto the church, are to have it 
given unto them to discern all 
those gifts lest there shall be any 
among you professing and yet be 
not of God. 

28. And it shall come to pass 
that he that asketh in Spirit shall 
receive in Spirit; 

29. That unto some it may be 
given to have *all those gifts, that 
there may be a head, in order 
that every member may be profit- 
ed thereby. 

30. He that asketh in the 
'Spirit asketh according to the 
will of God; wherefore it is done 
even as he asketh. 

31. And again, I say unto you, 
all things must be done in the 
name of Christ, whatsoever you 
do in the Spirit; 

32. And ye must give thanks 
unto God in the Spirit for what- 
soever blessing ye are blessed 
with. 

33. And ye must practise vir- 
tue and holiness before me con- 
tinually. Even so. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Kirtland, 
Ohio, March 8, 1831. Prior to this time Oliver Cowdery had acted as 
Church historian and recorder. John Whitmer had not sought an 
appointment as historian, but, being desired to serve in this capacity 
had said that he would obey the will of the Lord in the matter. See 

History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 166. John Whitmer designated 

as the keeper of the history of the Church. 



1. Behold, it is expedient in me 
that my servant John should 
write and keep a regular "history, 
and assist you, my servant Joseph, 
in transcribing all things which 
shall be given you, until he is 
called to further duties. 



2. Again, verily I say unto you 
that he can also lift up his voice 
in meetings, whenever it shall be 
expedient. 

3. And again, I say unto you 
that it shall be appointed unto 
him to keep the church record

4. Wherefore, it shall be given

by the Comforter, to write these 
things. Even so. Amen. 



SECTION 48. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, March, 1831. Joseph had inquired of the Lord as to the mode 
of procedure in procuring lands for the settlement of the Saints, this 
being an important matter in view of the migration of members of the 
Church from New York State, in obedience to the Lord's command 

that they should assemble in Ohio. The people already established 

in Ohio to share their holdings with new arrivals — Lands to be pur- 
chased as required — The people to follow the counsel of their presiding 
officers in the matter. 

5. The place is not yet to be 
revealed ; but after your brethren 
c come from the east there are to 
be certain men appointed, and to 
them it shall be given to know 
the place, or to them it shall be 
revealed. 

6. And they shall be appointed 
to purchase the lands, and to 
make a commencement to lay the 
'foundation of the city; and then 
shall ye begin to be gathered with 
your families, every man accord- 
ing to his family, according to his 
circumstances, and as is appointed 
to him by the presidency and the 
bishop of the church, according to 
the laws and commandments 
which ye have received, and which 
ye shall hereafter receive. Even 
so. Amen. 



1. It is necessary that ye should 
remain for the present time in 
your places of abode, as it shall 
be suitable to your circumstances. 

2. And inasmuch as ye have 
lands, ye shall impart to the 
"eastern brethren; 

3. And inasmuch as ye have 
not lands, let them buy for the 
present time in those regions 
round about, as seemeth them 
good, for it must needs be neces- 
sary that they have places to live 
for the present time. 

4. It must needs be necessary 
that ye save all the money that 
ye can, and that ye obtain all that 
ye can in righteousness, that in 
time ye may be enabled to pur- 
chase *land for an inheritance, 
even the city.

1831. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 167. Leman Copley had 
embraced the Gospel, but still held to some of the teachings of the 
Shakers, or Shaking Quakers, of whom he had formerly been one. 
Many of these people were honest-hearted, and the Lord directed his

Exact time of the Lord's advent 



ot to be revealed prior to the great event— Sanctity of marriage as 
law of God unto man — Complete abstinence from meat not required — 
evelopment of Lamanites and establishment of Zion to precede the 
&gt;ming of the great day of the Lord. 



1. Hearken unto my word, my 
*rvants Sidney, and Parley, and 
eman; for behold, verily I say 
nto you, that I give unto you a 
&gt;mmandment that you shall go 
ad preach °my gospel which ye 
ave received, even as ye have re- 
vived it, unto the Shakers. 

2. Behold, I say unto you, that 
*ey desire to know the truth in 
art, but not all, for they are not 
Lght before me and must needs 
spent. 

3. Wherefore, I send you, my 
arvants Sidney and Parley, to 
reach the gospel unto them. 

4. And my servant Leman shall 
e ordained unto this work, that 
e may reason with them, not ac- 
cording to that which he has re- 
Bived of them, but according to 
bat which shall be taught him 
y you my servants; and by so 
oing I will bless him, otherwise 
e shall not prosper. 

5. Thus saith the Lord; for I 
m God, and have sent mine 
&gt;nly Begotten Son into the world 
or the redemption of the world, 
nd have decreed that he that re- 
eiveth him shall be saved, and 
ie that receiveth him not shall 
•e damned — 

6. And they have done unto 
lie Son of Man even as they 
sted; and he has taken his power 
n the right hand of his glory, 
nd now reigneth in the heavens, 
.nd will reign till he ^descends 
n the earth to put all enemies 
nder his feet, which time is nigh 
t hand — 

7. I, the Lord God, have spok- 



en it; but the c hour and the day 
no man knoweth, neither the 
angels in heaven, nor shall they 
know until he comes. 

8. Wherefore, I will that all 
men shall repent, for all are un- 
der sin, except those which I have 
reserved unto myself, holy men 
that ye know not of. 

9. Wherefore, I say unto you 
that I have sent unto you mine 
Everlasting covenant, even that 
which was from the beginning. 

10. And that which I have 
promised I have so fulfilled, and 
the nations of the earth shall 
bow to it; and, if not of them- 
selves, they shall come down, for 
that which is now exalted of it- 
self shall be laid low of power. 

11. Wherefore, I give unto you 
a commandment that ye go among 
this people, and say unto them, 
like unto mine apostle of old, 
whose name was Peter: 

12. Believe on the name of the 
Lord Jesus, who was on the earth, 
and is to come, the beginning and 
the end; 

13. "Repent and be baptized in 
the name of Jesus Christ, accord- 
ing to the holy commandment, 
for the remission of sins; 

14. And whoso doeth this shall 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
by the laying on of the hands of 
the elders of the church. 

15. And again, verily I say 
unto you, that whoso forbiddeth 
to marry is not ordained of God, 
for 'marriage is ordained of God 
unto man.

he should have one wife, and they 
twain shall be one flesh, and all 
this that the earth might answer 
the end of its creation; 

17. And that it might be filled 
with the measure of man, accord- 
ing to his creation before the 
world was made. 

18. And whoso forbiddeth to 
abstain from meats, that man 
should not eat the same, is not 
ordained of Qod; 

19. For, behold, the beasts of 
the field and the fowls of the air, 
and that which cometh of the 
earth, is ordained for the use of 
man for food and for raiment, and 
that he might have in abundance. 

20. But it is 'not given that 
one man should possess that 
which is above another, where- 
fore the world lieth in sin. 

21. And wo be unto man that 
sheddeth blood or that wasteth 
flesh and hath no need. 

22. And again, verily I say 
unto you, that the Son of Man 
cometh not in the form of a wo- 
man, neither of a man traveling 
on the earth. 

23. Wherefore, be not deceived, 
but continue in steadfastness, 



looking forth for the 'heavens to 
be shaken, and the earth to 
1 tremble and to reel to and fro 
as a drunken man, and for the 
'valley 8 to be exalted, and for the 
mountains to be made low, and 
for the rough places to become 
smooth — and all this when the 
*angel shall sound his trumpet 

24. But before the great day 
of the Lord shall come, Jacob 
shall 'flourish in the wilderness, 
and the Lamanites shall "blos- 
som as the rose. 

25. Zion shall "flourish upon 
the hills and rejoice upon the 
"mountains, and shall be assem- 
bled together unto the place 
which I have appointed. 

26. Behold, I say unto you, go 
forth as I have commanded yon; 
repent of all your sins; p ask and 
ye shall receive; knock and it 
shall be opened unto you. 

27. Behold, I will go before 
you and be your rearward; and 
I will be in your midst, and yon 
shall not be confounded. 

28. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, 
and I 'come quickly. Even so. 
Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, May, 1831, The Prophet states that some of the Elders present 
did not understand the manifestations of different spirits abroad m»

required of certain Elders — Greater knowledge promised as the people 
shall grow in grace and truth — The Lord is the Good Shepherd and 
the Stone of Israel. 

1. Hearken, O ye eiders of my 
church, and give ear to the voice 
of the living Qod; and attend to 
the words of wisdom which shall 
be given unto you, according as 
ye have asked and are agreed as 
touching the church, and the 
spirits which have gone abroad in 
the earth. 

2. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, that there are many spirits 
which are false spirits, which 
have gone forth in the earth, de- 
ceiving the world. 

3. And also Satan hath sought 
to deceive you, that he might 
overthrow you. 

4. Behold, I, the Lord, have 
looked upon you, and have seen 
abominations in the church that 
profess my name. 

5. But blessed are they who 
are faithful and endure, whether 
in life or in death, for they shall 
inherit eternal life. 

6. But wo unto them that are 
deceivers and hypocrites, for, thus 
saith the Lord, I will bring them 
to judgment. 

7. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, there are hypocrites among 
you, who have deceived some, 
which has given the adversary 
power; but behold such shall be 
reclaimed; 

8. But the hypocrites shall be 
detected and shall be cut off, 
either in life or in death, even as 
I will; and "wo unto them who 
are cut off from my church, for 
the same are overcome of the 
world. 

9. Wherefore, let every man 
beware lest he do that which is 
not in truth and righteousness 
before me. 



10. And now come, saith the 
Lord, by the Spirit, unto the 
elders of his church, and let us 
reason together, that ye may un- 
derstand; 

11. Let us reason even as a 
man reasoneth one with another 
face to face. 

12. Now, when a man reason- 
eth he is understood of man, be- 
cause he reasoneth as a man; 
even so will I, the Lord, reason 
with you that you may under- 
stand. 

13. Wherefore, I the Lord ask 
you this question — unto what 
were ye ordained? 

14. To preach my gospel by 
the 6 Spirit, even the Comforter 
which was sent forth to teach 
the truth. 

15. And then received ye spir- 
its which ye could not under- 
stand, and received them to be 
of Qod; and in this are ye jus- 
tified? 

16. Behold ye shall answer 
this question yourselves; never- 
theless, I will be merciful unto 
you; he that is weak among you 
hereafter shall be made strong. 

17. Verily I say unto you, he 
that is ordained of me and sent 
forth to preach the word of truth 
by the Comforter, in the Spirit 
of truth, doth he preach it by the 
Spirit of truth or some other 
way? 

18. And if it be by some other 
way it is not of God. 

19. And again, he that receiv- 
eth the word of truth, doth he 
receive it by the Spirit of truth 
or some other way? 

20. If it be some other way it 
is not of God.

21. Therefore, why is It that 
ye cannot understand and know, 
that he that receiveth the word 
by the Spirit of truth receiveth 
it as it is preached by the Spirit 
of truth? 

22. Wherefore, he that preach- 
eth and he that receiveth, under- 
stand one another, and both are 
edified and rejoice together. 

23. And that which doth not 
edify is not of God, and is dark- 
ness. 

24. That which is of God is 
light; and he that receiveth light, 
c and continueth in God, receiveth 
more light; and that light grow- 
eth brighter and brighter until 
the perfect day. 

25. And again, verily I say 
unto you, and I say it that you 
may know the truth, that you 
may chase darkness from among 
you; 

26. He that is ordained of God 
and sent forth, the same is ap- 
pointed to be the greatest, not- 
withstanding he is the least and 
the servant of all. 

27. Wherefore, he is possessor 
of all things; for d all things are 
subject unto him, both in heaven 
and on the earth, the life and 
the light, the Spirit and the 
power, sent forth by the will of 
the Father through Jesus Christ, 
his Son. 

28. But no man is possessor of 
all things except e he be purified 
and cleansed from all sin. 

29. And if ye are purified and 
cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask 
'whatsoever you will in the name 
of Jesus and it shall be done. 

30. But know this, it shall be 
given you what you shall ask; 
and as ye are appointed to the 



head, the spirits shall be subject 
unto you. 

31. Wherefore, it shall come 
to pass, that if you behold a spirit 
manifested that you cannot un- 
derstand, and you receive not that 
spirit, ye shall ask of the Father 
in the name of Jesus; and if he 
give 'not unto you that spirit, 
then you may know that it is not 
of God. 

32. And it shall be given unto 
you, power over that spiritp and 
you shall proclaim against; that 
spirit with a loud voice that it is 
not of God — 

33. Not with railing accusa- 
tion, that ye be not overcome, 
neither with boasting nor rejoic- 
ing, lest you be seized therewith. 

34. He that receiveth of God, 
let him account it of God; and 
let him rejoice that he is ac- 
counted of God worthy to receive. 

35. And by giving heed and 
doing these things which ye have 
received, and which ye shall here- 
after receive — and the "kingdom 
is given you of the Father, and 
power to overcome all things 
which are not ordained of him — 

36. And behold, verily I say 
unto you, blessed are you who 
are now hearing these words of 
mine from the mouth of my ser- 
vant, for your sins are forgiven 
you. 

37. Let my servant Joseph 
Wakefield, in whom I am well 
pleased, and my servant Parley P. 
Pratt go forth among the churches 
and strengthen them by the word 
of exhortation;

me and I in you.

herd, and the m stone of Israel.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Thomp-

State of New York began to arrive in Ohio; and it became necessary 
to make definite arrangements for their settlement. As this undertak- 
ing belonged particularly to the bishop's office, Bishop Edward Part- 
ridge sought instruction on the matter; and the Prophet inquired of 

the Lord. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 173. Provision

Ohio consecrated to the Church for a little season only. 



1. Hearken unto me, saith the

he receive directions how to or-

according to the laws and cove- 
nants of the church, to belong to 
the church. 

5. And if he shall transgress 
and is c not accounted worthy to 
belong to the church, he shall 
not have power to claim that por- 
tion which he has consecrated 
unto the bishop for the poor and 
needy of my church; therefore, 
he shall not retain the gift, but 
shall only have claim on that por- 
tion that is d deeded unto him. 

6. And thus all things shall be 
made sure, according to the laws 
of the land. 

7. And let that which belongs 
to this people be appointed unto 
this people. 

8. And the money which is left 
unto this people — let there be an 
agent appointed unto this people, 
to take the money to provide food 
and raiment, according to the 
wants of this people. 

9. And let every man deal 
honestly, and be "alike among 
this people, and receive alike, 
that ye may be one, even as I 
have commanded you. 

10. And let that which belong- 
eth to this people not be taken 
and given unto that of another 
church. 

11. Wherefore, if another 
church would receive money of 
this church, let them 'pay unto 
this church again according as 
they shall agree; 

12. And this shall be done 
through the bishop or the agent, 



which shall be appointed by the 
voice of the church. 

13. And again, let the bishop 
appoint a 'storehouse unto this 
church; and let all things both in 
money and in meat, which are 
more than is needful for the 
wants of this people, be kept in 
the hands of the bishop. 

14. And let him also reserve 
unto himself for his own wants, 
and for the wants of his family, 
as he shall be employed in doing 
this business. 

15. And thus I grant unto this 
people a privilege ot organizing 
themselves according to *my laws. 

1 6 . And I consecrate unto them 
this land for a little season, until 
I, the Lord, shall provide for them 
otherwise, and command them to 
go hence; 

17. And the hour and the day 
is not given unto them, where- 
fore let them act upon this land 
as for years, and this shall turn 
unto them for their good. 

18. Behold, this shall be an 
Example unto my servant Ed- 
ward Partridge, in other places, 
in all churches. 

19. And whoso is found a 
faithful, a just, and a 'wise 
steward shall enter into the joy 
of his Lord, and shall inherit 
eternal life. 

20. Verily, I say unto you, I 
am Jesus Christ, who *cometh 
quickly, in an hour you think not. 
Even so. Amen.

At this conference the first distinctive ordinations to the office of 
High Priest were made; and certain manifestations of false and de- 
ceiving spirits were discerned and rebuked. See History of the Church, 
vol. 1, p. 175. Missouri designated as the place for the next suc- 
ceeding conference — Elders named with their respective appointments 
to travel two by two, preaching and baptizing. 

1. Behold, thus saith the Lord 
unto the elders whom he hath 
called and chosen in these last 
days, by the voice of his Spirit — 

2. Saying: I, the Lord, will 
make known unto you what I 
will that ye shall do from this 
time until the next conference, 
which shall be held in Missouri, 
upon the land which I will con- 
secrate unto my people, which 
are a "remnant of Jacob, and 
those who are b heirs according 
to the covenant. 

3. Wherefore, verily I say unto 
you, let my servants Joseph Smith, 
Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take 
their journey as soon as prepara- 
tions can be made to leave their 
homes, and journey to the land 
of Missouri. 

4. And inasmuch as they are 
faithful unto me, it shall be made 
known unto them what they shall 
do; 

5. And it shall also, inasmuch 
as they are faithful, be made 
'known unto them the land of 
your inheritance. 

6. And inasmuch as they are 
not faithful, they shall be cut off , 
even as I will, as seemeth me 
good. 

7. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let my servant Lyman 
Wight and my servant John Cor- 
rill take their journey speedily; 

8. And also my servant John 
Murdock, and my servant Hyrum 
Smith, take their journey unto 
the same place by the way of 
Detroit. 



9. And let them journey from 
thence preaching the word by the 
way, saying none other things 
than that which the prophets and 
apostles have written, and that 
which is taught them by the Com- 
forter through the prayer of faith. 

10. Let them go two by two, 
and thus let them preach by the 
way in every congregation, bap- 
tizing by water, and the "laying 
on of the hands by the water's 
side. 

11. For thus saith the Lord, I 
will cut my work short in right- 
eousness, for the days come that 
I will send forth judgment unto 
victory. 

12. And let my servant Lyman 
Wight beware, for Satan desireth 
to sift him as chaff. 

13. And behold, he that is 
faithful shall be made ruler over 
many things. 

14. And again, I will give unto 
you a 'pattern in all things, that 
ye may not be deceived ; for Satan 
is abroad in the land, and he 
goeth forth deceiving the na- 
tions — 

15. Wherefore he that pray- 
eth, whose spirit is contrite, the 
same is accepted of me if he obey 
mine ordinances. 

16. He that speaketh, whose 
spirit is contrite, whose language 
is meek and edifleth, the same is 
of God if he obey mine ordi- 
nances. 

17. And again, he that trem- 
bleth under my power shall be 
made strong, and shall bring forth

fruits of praise and wisdom, ac- 
cording to the revelations and 
truths which I have given you. 

18. And again, he that is over- 
come and bringeth not forth 
fruits, even according to this pat- 
tern, is not of me. 

19. Wherefore, by this 'pattern 
ye shall know the spirits in all 
cases under the whole heavens. 

20. And the days have come; 
according to men's faith it shall 
be done unto. them. 

21. Behold, this commandment 
is given unto all the elders whom 
I have chosen. 

22. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let my servant Thomas 
B. Marsh and my servant Ezra 
Thayre take their journey also, 
preaching the word by the way 
unto this same land. 

23. And again, let my servant 
Isaac Morley and my servant Ezra 
Booth take their journey, also 
preaching the word by the way 
unto this same land. 

24. And again, let my servants 
Edward Partridge and Martin 
Harris take their journey with 
my servants Sidney Rigdon and 
Joseph Smith, Jun. 

25. Let my servants David 
Whitmer and Harvey Whitlock 
also take their journey, and 
preach by the way unto this same 
land. 

26. And let my servants Parley 
P. Pratt and Orson Pratt take 
their journey, and preach by the 
way, even unto this same land. 

27. And let my servants Solo- 
mon Hancock and Simeon Carter 
also take their journey unto this 
same land, and preach by the way. 

28. Let my servants Edson 
Fuller and Jacob Scott also take 
their journey. 

29. Let my servants Levi W. 



Hancock and Zebedee Coltrin also 
take their journey. 

30. Let my servants Reynolds 
Cahoon and Samuel H. Smith also 
take their journey. 

31. Let my servants Wheeler 
Baldwin and William Carter also 
take their journey. 

32. And let my servants Newel 
Knight and Selah J. Griffin both 
be ordained, and also take their 
journey. 

33. Yea, verily I say, let all 
these take their journey unto one 
place, in their several courses, 
and one man shall not build upon 
another's foundation, neither 
journey in another's track. 

34. He that is faithful, the 
same shall be kept and blessed 
with much fruit. 

35. And again, I say unto you, 
let my servants Joseph Wakefield 
and Solomon Humphrey take 
their journey into the eastern 
lands; 

36. Let them labor with their 
families, declaring none other 
things than the prophets and 
apostles, that which they have 
seen and heard and most assured- 
ly believe, that the prophecies 
may be fulfilled. 

37. In consequence of trans- 
gression, let that which was be- 
stowed upon Heman Basset be 
taken from him, and placed upon 
the head of Simonds Ryder. 

38. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let Jared Carter be or- 
dained a priest, and also George 
James be ordained a priest. 

39. Let the residue of the 
elders watch over the churches, 
and declare the word in the 
regions round about them; and 
let them labor with their own 
hands that there be no idolatry 
nor wickedness practised. 

40. And remember in all things

and the afflicted, for he that doeth 
not these things, the same is not

41. And again, let my servants 
Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney 
Rigdon and Edward Partridge 
take with them a recommend 
from the church. And let there 
be one obtained for my servant 
Oliver Cowdery also. 

42. And thus, even as I have 
said, if ye are faithful ye shall 



assemble yourselves together to 
rejoice upon the land of Missouri, 
which is the *land of your inheri- 
tance, which is now the land of 
your enemies. 

43. But, behold, I, the Lord, 
will hasten the *city in its time, 
and will crown the faithful with

branch at Thompson, Ohio, were divided on certain questions of Church 
administration, and selfishness was manifest amongst them. Newel 
Knight and other Elders had come to the Prophet asking how to 

proceed. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 180. Some who 

had entered the Church had broken their covenants — Newel Knight to 
journey to Missouri. 

1. Behold, thus saith the Lord, 
even Alpha and Omega, the be- 
ginning and the end, even he who 
was crucified for the sins of the 
world — 

2. Behold, verily, verily, I say 
unto you, my servant Newel 
Knight, you shall stand fast in 
the office whereunto I have ap- 
pointed you. 

3. And if your brethren desire 
to escape their enemies, let them 
repent of all their sins, and be- 
come truly humble before me and 
contrite. 

4. And as the "covenant which 
they made unto me has been 
broken, even so it has become 
void and of none effect. 

5. And b wo to him by whom 
this offense cometh, for it had 
been better for him that he had 
been drowned in the depth of the 
sea. 

6. But blessed are they who 
have kept the covenant and ob- 



served the commandment, for 
they shall obtain mercy. 

7. Wherefore, go to now and 
c flee the land, lest your enemies 
come upon you; and take your' 
journey, and appoint whom yon 
will to be your leader, and to pay 
moneys for you. 

8. And thus you shall take 
your journey into the regions 
westward, unto the land of Mis- 
souri, unto the borders of the 
Lamanites. 

9. And after you have done 
journeying, behold, I say unto 
you, seek ye a living like unto 
men, until I prepare a place for 
you. 

10. And again, be patient in 
tribulation until I come; and, be-

reward is with me, and they who 
have sought me "early shall find 
rest to their souls. Even so. 
Amen.

5. And again, verily I say unto 
you, for this cause you shall take

Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney

in the land of your inheritance to 
do this work. 

6. And again, let my servant

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, June, 1831. Elder Ezra Thayre, who had been appointed to 
travel in the ministry with Elder Thomas B. Marsh, was unable to 
start on his mission when the latter was ready, and the Lord answered 

the Prophet's inquiry on the matter by giving this revelation, 

The Lord may and does revoke as well as command — Ezra Thayre re- 
buked for pride and selfishness — Selah J. Griffin appointed in his place 
to travel with Thomas B. Marsh — Offenders reproved, both rich and 
poor — Necessity of repentance as expressed by the broken heart and 
contrite spirit. 

1. Hearken, O ye people who 
profess my name, saith the Lord 
your God; for behold, mine anger 
is kindled against the rebellious, 
and they shall know mine arm

of visitation and of wrath upon 
the nations. 

2. And he that will not take

SECTION 57. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Zion, 
Jackson County, Missouri, July, 1831. In compliance with the Lord's 
command, the Elders had journeyed from Kirtland to Missouri with 
many varied experiences and some opposition. In contemplating the 
degraded state of the Lamanites and the lack of civilization, refinement 
and religion among the people generally, the Prophet exclaimed in 
yearning prayer: When will the wilderness blossom as the rose? 
When will Zion be built up in her glory, and where will thy Temple 
stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last days? See History 

of the Church, vol. 1, p. 189. The land appointed and consecrated — 

The land of promise — The place for the city of Zion — The center place 
specified — The Saints directed to purchase land — Commanded to make 
preparation for others who are to come. 



1. Hearken, O ye elders of my 
church, saith the Lord your God, 
who have assembled yourselves 
together, according to my com- 
mandments, in this land, which 
is the land of Missouri, which is 
the land which I have "appointed 
and consecrated for the gather- 
ing of the saints. 

2. Wherefore, this is the land 
of promise, and the "place for the 
city of Zion. 

3. And thus saith the Lord 
your God, if you will receive wis- 
dom here is wisdom. Behold, the 
place which is now called Inde- 
pendence is the center place; and 
a c spot for the temple is lying 
westward, upon a lot which is 
not far from the court-house. 

4. Wherefore, it is wisdom that 
the land should be purchased by 
the saints, and also every tract 
lying westward, even unto the 
line running directly between Jew 
and Gentile; 

5. And also every tract bor- 
dering by the prairies, inasmuch 
as my disciples are enabled to buy 
lands. Behold, this is wisdom, 
that they may obtain it for an 
'everlasting inheritance. 



6. And let my servant Sidney 
Gilbert stand in the office to which 
I have appointed him, to receive 
moneys, to be an 'agent unto the 
church, to buy land in all the 
regions round about, inasmuch 
as can be done in righteousness, 
and as wisdom shall direct. 

7. And let my servant Edward 
Partridge stand in the office to 
which I have appointed him, and 
'divide unto the saints their in- 
heritance, even as I have com- 
manded; and also those whom he 
has appointed to assist him. 

8. And again, verily I say unto 
you, let my servant Sidney Gil- 
bert plant himself in this place, 
and establish a store, that he may 
sell goods without fraud, that he 
may obtain money Ho buy lands 
for the good of the saints, and 
that he may obtain whatsoever 
things the disciples may need to 
plant them in their inheritance. 

9. And also let my servant Sid- 
ney Gilbert obtain a license — be- 
hold here is wisdom, and whoso 
readeth let him understand — that 
he may send goods also unto the 
people, even by whom he will as 
clerks employed in his service;

10. And thus provide for my 
saints, that my gospel may be 
preached unto those who sit in 
darkness and in the region and 
shadow of death. 

11. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let my servant William 
W. Phelps be planted in this 
place, and be established as a 
printer unto the church. 

12. And lo, if the world re- 
ceive his writings — behold here 
is wisdom — let him obtain what- 
soever he can obtain in righteous- 
ness, for the good of the saints. 

13. And let my servant Oliver 
Cowdery assist him, even as I 
have commanded, in whatsoever 
place I shall appoint unto him, 
to copy, and to correct, and select, 



that all things may be right be- 
fore me, as it shall be proved by 
the Spirit through him. 

14. And thus let those of whom 
I have spoken be planted in the 
land of *Zion, as speedily as can 
be, with their families, to do those 
things even as I have spoken. 

15. And now concerning the 
gathering — Let the bishop and 
the agent make preparations for 
those families which have been 
commanded to come to this land, 
as soon as possible, and plant 
them in their inheritance. 

16. And unto the residue of 
both elders and members further 
directions shall be given here- 
after. Even so. Amen. 



SECTION 58. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Zion, 
Jackson County, Missouri, August 1, 1831. On the first Sabbath after 
the arrival of the Prophet and party in Jackson County, Missouri, a 
religious service was held and two members were received by baptism. 
During that week, members of the Colesville branch and others arrived. 
See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 190. Many were eager to learn 

the will of the Lord concerning them in the new place of gathering. 

Great things to follow, with glory, after much tribulation— Certain 
duties of the Bishopric — The Bishop is warned — People instructed to 
observe the laws of the land, and to regard the commandments given 
through revelation as the laws of the Church — Servants not to be com- 
pelled in all things but to be diligent and active — Lands to be purchased 
in Independence — Some of the people to stay, others to travel in the 
ministry — Assignment of duty to individual Elders — Those returning 
to the East to bear record of what they have seen and know concerning 
the land of Zion — Gathering of the Saints not to be conducted in haste. 

1. Hearken, O ye elders of my 
church, and give ear to my word, 
and learn of me what I will con- 
cerning you, and also concerning 
this land unto which I have sent 
you. 

2. For verily I say unto you, 
blessed is he that keepeth my 



i, see b, sec. 25. 



commandments, whether in life 
or in death; and he that is faith- 
ful in tribulation, the reward of 
the same is greater in the king- 
dom of heaven. 

3. Ye cannot behold with your 
natural eyes, for the present time, 
the design of your God concern- 1

ing those things which shall come 
hereafter, and the glory which 
shall follow after much tribula- 
tion. 

4. For after "much tribulation 
come the blessings. Wherefore 
the day cometh that ye shall be 
crowned with much glory; the 
hour is not yet, but is nigh at 
hand. 

5. Remember this, which I tell 
you before, that you may lay it to 
heart, and receive that which is 
to follow. 

6. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, for this cause I have sent 
you — that you might be obedient, 
and that your hearts might be 
prepared to bear testimony of the 
things which are to come; 

7. And also that you might be 
honored in laying the foundation, 
and in bearing record of the land 
upon which the b Zion of God shall 
stand ; 

8. And also that a feast of fat 
things might be prepared for the 
poor; yea, a feast of fat things, 
of wine on the lees well refined, 
that the earth may know that the 
mouths of the prophets shall not 
fail; 

9. Yea, a supper of the house 
of the Lord, well prepared, unto 
which all nations shall be invited. 

10. First, the rich and the 
learned, the wise and the noble; 

11. And after that cometh the 
c day of my power; then shall the 
poor, the lame, and the blind, and 
the deaf, come in unto the mar- 
riage of the Lamb, and partake 
of the supper of the Lord, pre- 
pared for the great day to come. 

12. Behold, I, the Lord, have 
spoken it. 

13. And that the testimony 
might go forth from d Zion, yea, 



from the mouth of the city of the 
heritage of God — 

14. Yea, for this cause I have 
sent you hither, and have se- 
lected my servant Edward Part- 
ridge, and have appointed unto 
him his mission in this land. 

15. But if he repent not of his 
sins, which are unbelief and blind- 
ness of heart, let him take heed 
lest he fall. 

16. Behold his mission is given 
unto him, and it shall not be 
given again. 

17. And whoso standeth in this 
mission is appointed to be a 
'judge in Israel, like as it was 
in ancient days, to divide the 
lands of the heritage of God unto 
his children; 

18. And to judge his people 
by the testimony of the just, and 
by the assistance of his coun- 
selors, according to the laws of 
the kingdom which are given by 
the prophets of God. 

19. For verily I say unto you, 
my law shall be kept on this 
land. 

20. Let no man think he is 
ruler; but let God rule him that 
judgeth, according to the coun- 
sel of his own will, or, in other 
words, him that counseleth or 
sitteth upon the judgment seat. 

21. Let no man 'break the 
laws of the land, for he that 
keepeth the laws of God hath no 
need to break the laws of the 
land. 

22. Wherefore, be subject to 
the powers that be, until he 
reigns whose right it is to reign, 
and subdues all enemies under 
his feet. 

23. Behold, the laws which ye 
have received from my hand are 
the laws of the church, and in

this light ye shall hold them 
forth. Behold, here is wisdom. 

24. And now, as I spake con- 
cerning my servant Edward Part- 
ridge, this land is the land of his 
residence, and those whom he has 
appointed for his counselors; and 
also the land of the residence of 
him whom I have appointed to 
keep my storehouse; 

25. Wherefore, let them hring 
their families to this land, as they 
shall counsel between themselves 
and me. 

26. For behold, it is not meet 
that I should command in all 
things; for he that is compelled 
in all things, the same is a sloth- 
ful and not a wise servant ; where- 
fore he receiveth no reward. 

27. Verily I say, men should 
be anxiously engaged in a good 
cause, and do 'many things of 
their own free will, and bring to 
pass much righteousness; 

28. For the power is in them, 
wherein they are agents unto 
themselves. And inasmuch as 
men do good they shall in nowise 
lose their reward. 

29. But he that doeth not any- 
thing until he is commanded, and 
receiveth a commandment with 
doubtful heart, and keepeth it 
with slothfulness, the same is 
damned. 

30. Who am I that made man, 
saith the Lord, that will hold him 
guiltless that obeys not my com- 
mandments? 

31. Who am I, saith the Lord, 
that have promised and have not 
fulfilled? 

32. I command and men obey 
not; I revoke and they receive 
not the blessing. 

33. Then they say in their 
hearts: This is not the work of 
the Lord, for his promises are 



not fulfilled. But wo unto such, 
for their reward lurketh beneath, 
and not from above. 

34. And now I give unto you 
further directions concerning this 
land. 

35. It is wisdom in me that my 
servant Martin Harris should be 
an example unto the church, in 
Maying his moneys before the 
bishop of the church. 

36. And also, this is a 'law 
unto every man that cometh unto 
this land to receive an inheri- 
tance; and he shall do with his 
moneys according as the law 
directs. 

37. And it is wisdom also that 
there should be lands purchased 
in Independence, for the place of 
the storehouse, and also for the 
house of the printing. 

38. And other directions con- 
cerning my servant Martin Harris 
shall be given him of the Spirit, 
that he may receive his inheri- 
tance as seemeth him good ; 

39. And let him repent of his 
sins, for he seeketh the praise of 
the world. 

40. And also let my servant 
William W. Phelps stand in the 
office to which I have appointed 
him, and receive his inheritance 
in the land; 

41. And also he hath need to 
repent, for I, the Lord, am not 
well pleased with him, for he 
seeketh to excel, and he is not 
sufficiently meek before me. 

42. Behold, he who has re- 
pented of his sins, the same is 
forgiven, and I, the Lord, re- 
member them no more. 

43. By this ye may know if a 
man repenteth of his sins — be- 
hold, he will 'confess them and 
forsake them. 

44. And now, verily, I say con-

corning the residue of the elders 
*&gt;f my church, the time has not 
yet come, for many years, for 
them to receive their inheritance 
In this land, except they desire it 
through the prayer of faith, only 
as it shall be appointed unto them 
of the Lord. 

45. For, behold, they shall 
*push the people together from 
the ends of the earth. 

46. Wherefore, assemble your- 
selves together; and they who are 
not appointed to stay in this land, 
let them preach the gospel in the 
regions round about; and after 
that let them return to their 
homes. 

47. Let them preach by the 
way, and bear testimony of the 
truth in all places, and call upon 
the rich, the high and the low, 
and the poor to repent. 

48. And let them build up 
churches, inasmuch as the inhabi- 
tants of the earth will repent. 

49. And let there be an agent 
appointed by the voice of the 
church, unto the church in Ohio, 
to receive moneys to purchase 
lands in Zion. 

50. And I give unto my ser- 
vant Sidney Rigdon a command- 
ment, that he shall write a de- 
scription of the land of Zion, and 
a statement of the will of God, 
as it shall be made known by 
the Spirit unto him; 

51. And an epistle and sub- 
scription, to be presented unto all 
the churches to obtain moneys, 
to be put into the hands of the 
bishop, of himself or the agent, 
as seemeth him good or as he 
shall direct, to "purchase lands 
for an inheritance for the chil- 
dren of God. 

52. For, behold, verily I say 
unto you, the Lord willeth that 



the disciples and the children of 
men should open their hearts, 
even to purchase this whole 
region of country, as soon as time 
will permit. 

53. Behold, here is wisdom. 
Let them do this lest they receive 
"none inheritance, save it be by 
the shedding of blood. 

54. And again, inasmuch as 
there is land obtained, let there 
be workmen sent forth of all 
kinds unto this land, to labor for 
the saints -of God. 

55. Let all these things be done 
in order; and let the privileges 
of the lands be made known from 
time to time, by the bishop or the 
agent of the church. 

56. And let the work of the 
fathering be not in haste, nor 
by flight; but let it be done as it 
shall be counseled by the elders 
of the church at the conferences, 
according to the knowledge which 
they receive from time to time. 

57. And let my servant Sidney 
Rigdon 'consecrate and dedicate 
this land, and the spot for the 
temple, unto the Lord. 

58. And let a conference meet- 
ing be called; and after that let 
my servants Sidney Rigdon and 
Joseph Smith, Jun., return, and 
also Oliver Cowdery with them, 
to accomplish the residue of the 
work which I have appointed 
unto them in their own land, and 
the residue as shall be ruled by 
the conferences. 

59. And let no man return 
from this land except he bear 
record by the way, of that which 
he knows and most assuredly be- 
lieves. 

60. Let that which has been 
bestowed upon «Ziba Peterson be 
taken from him; and let him 
stand as a member in the church,

and labor with his own hands, 
with the brethren, until he is 
sufficiently chastened for all his 
sins; for he confesseth them not, 
and he thinketh to hide them. 

61. Let the residue of the eld- 
ers of this church, who are com- 
ing to this land, some of whom 
are exceedingly blessed even 
above measure, also hold a con- 
ference upon this land. 

62. And let my servant Edward 
Partridge direct the conference 
which shall be held by them. 



63. And let them also return, 
preaching the gospel by the way, 
bearing record of the things 
which are revealed unto them. 

64. For, verily, the sound must 
go forth from this place into all 
the world, and unto the uttermost 
parts of the earth — r the gospel 
must be preached unto every 
creature, with signs following 
them that believe. 

65. And behold the 'Son of 
Man cometh. Amen.

SECTION 59. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Zion, 
Jackson County, Missouri, August 7, 1831. Preceding his record of 
this revelation, the Prophet writes descriptively of the land of Zion 
wherein the people were then assembled. See History of the Church, 
vol. 1, p. 196. The land was consecrated, as the Lord had directed, 
and the site for the future Temple was dedicated. The Lord makes 

these commandments especially applicable to the Saints in Zion.  

The people commended for their obedience in gathering to Jackson 
County — Certain of the commandments given in the decalog reiterated— 
Sanctity of the Sabbath emphasized — Not confessing the hand of God 
in all things a grievous offense. 



1. Behold, blessed, saith the 
Lord, are they who have come up 
unto this land with an eye single 
to my glory, according to my 
commandments. 

2. For those that live shall in- 
herit the earth, and those that 
die shall rest from all their la- 
bors, and their works shall follow 
them; and they shall receive a 
crown in the "mansions of my Fa- 
ther, which I have prepared for 
them. 

3. Yea, blessed are they whose 
feet stand upon the land of Zion, 
who have obeyed my gospel; for 
they shall receive for their re- 



ward the good things of the earth, 
and it shall bring forth in its 
strength. 

4. And they shall also be 
crowned with blessings from 
above, yea, and with command- 
ments not a few, and with revela- 
tions in their time — they that are 
faithful and diligent before me. 

5. Wherefore, I give unto them 
a commandment, saying thus: 
&amp; Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with all thy heart, with all 
thy might, mind, and strength; 
and in the name of Jesus Christ 
thou shalt serve him. 

6. Thou shalt love thy neigh-

bor as thyself. Thou shalt not 
steal; neither commit adultery, 
nor kill, nor do anything like 
unto it. 

7. Thou shalt thank the Lord 
thy God in all things. 

8. Thou shalt offer a sacrifice 
unto the Lord thy God in right- 
eousness, even that of a broken 
heart and a contrite spirit. 

9. And that thou mayest more 
fully keep thyself unspotted from 
the world, thou shalt e go to the 
house of prayer and offer up thy 
sacraments upon my holy day; 

10. For verily this is a day 
appointed unto you to rest from 
your labors, and to pay thy de- 
votions unto the Most High; 

11. Nevertheless thy vows shall 
be offered up in righteousness on 
all days and at all times; 

12. But remember that on this, 
the "Lord's day, thou shalt offer 
thine oblations and thy sacra- 
ments unto the Most High, con- 
fessing thy sins unto thy breth- 
ren, and before the Lord. 

13. And on this day thou shalt 
do none other thing, only let thy 
food be prepared with singleness 
of heart that thy fasting may be 
perfect, or, in other words, that 
thy joy may be full. 

14. Verily, this is fasting and 
prayer, or in other words, rejoic- 
ing and prayer. 

15. And inasmuch as ye do 
these things with thanksgiving, 
with cheerful hearts and counte- 
nances, not with "much laughter, 
for this is sin, but with a glad 
heart and a cheerful counte- 
nance — 

16. Verily I say, that inasmuch 



as ye do this, the fulness of the 
earth is yours, the beasts of the 
field and the fowls of the air, 
and that which climbeth upon 
the trees and walketh upon the 
earth; 

17. Yea, and the herb, and the 
good things which come of the 
earth, whether for food or for rai- 
ment, or for houses, or for barns, 
or for orchards, or for gardens, or 
for vineyards; 

18. Yea, all things which come 
of the earth, in the season there- 
of, are made for the benefit and 
the use of man, both to please 
the eye and to gladden the heart ; 

19. Yea, for food and for rai- 
ment, for taste and for smell, to 
strengthen the body and to en- 
liven the soul. 

20. And it pleaseth God that 
he hath given all these things 
unto man; for unto this end were 
they made to be used, with judg- 
ment, not to excess, neither by 
extortion. 

21. And in nothing doth man 
offend God, or against none is 
his wrath kindled, save those 
'who confess not his hand in all 
things, and obey not his com- 
mandments. 

22. Behold, this is according 
to the law and the prophets; 
wherefore, trouble me no more 
concerning this matter. 

23. But learn that he who 
doeth the works of righteousness 
shall receive his reward, even 
peace in this world, and eternal 
life in the world to come. 

24. I, the Lord, have spoken 
it, and the Spirit beareth record. 
Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Jackson

Elders who had been appointed to return to the East desiring to

should travel. Reproof for those who neglect to use their talents

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, ort the 
bank of the Missouri river, Mcllwaine's Bend, August 12, 1831. The 
Prophet and ten Elders had traveled down the river in canoes. On the 
first day of the journey many dangers were experienced. Elder William 
W. Phelps, in daylight vision, saw the destroyer riding in power upon 

the face of the waters. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 203. 

Elders not to travel swiftly upon the river, thus losing opportunity to 
preachy-Elders had been permitted to come thus far by boat that they 
might bear record of the power of the destroyer over the waters — 
Those who come later to Zion to be warned thereof — Attention of the 
First Presidency needed in the organized branches — Special labor of 
declaring the Gospel to non-members left to the Elders thereto ap- 
pointed. 

1. Behold, and hearken unto 
the voice of him who has all 
power, who is from "everlasting 
to everlasting, even Alpha and 
Omega, the beginning and the 
end. 

2. Behold, verily thus saith 
the Lord unto you, O ye elders 
of my church, who are assembled 
upon this spot, whose sins are 
now forgiven you, for I, the Lord, 
forgive sins, and am merciful 
unto those who confess their sins 
with humble hearts; 

3. But verily I say unto you, 
that it is not needful for this 
whole company of mine elders to 
be moving swiftly upon the wa- 
ters, whilst the inhabitants on 



either side are perishing in un- 
belief. 

4. Nevertheless, I suffered it 
that ye might bear record; be- 
hold, there are many dangers 
upon the waters, and more espe- 
cially hereafter; 

5. For I, the Lord, have de- 
creed in mine anger many de- 
structions upon the waters; yea, 
and especially upon these waters. 

6. Nevertheless, all flesh is in 
mine hand, and he that is faith- 
ful among you shall not perish 
by the waters. 

7. Wherefore, it is expedient 
that my servant Sidney Gilbert 
and my servant William W. 
Phelps be in haste upon their 
errand and mission.

8. Nevertheless, I would not 
suffer that ye should part until 
you were chastened for all your 
sins, that you might be one, that 
you might not perish in wicked- 
ness; 

9. But now, verily I say, it be- 
hooveth me that ye should part. 
Wherefore let my servants Sidney 
Gilbert and William W. Phelps 
take their former company, and 
let them take their journey in 
haste that they may fill their mis- 
sion, and through faith they shall 
overcome; 

10. And inasmuch as they are 
faithful they shall be preserved, 
and I, the Lord, will be with 
them. 

11. And let the residue take 
that which is needful for cloth- 
ing. 

12. Let my servant Sidney Gil- 
bert take that which is not need- 
ful with him, as you shall agree. 

13. And now, behold, for your 
good I gave unto you a command- 
ment concerning these things; 
and I, the Lord, will reason with 
you as with men in days of 
old. 

14. Behold, I, the Lord, in the 
beginning blessed the waters; but 
in the last days, by the mouth of 
my servant John, I 6 cursed the 
waters. 

15. Wherefore, the days will 
come that no flesh shall be safe 
upon the waters. 

16. And it shall be said in 
days to come that none is able 
to go up to the land of Zion upon 
the waters, but he that is up- 
right in heart. 

17. And, as I, the Lord, in the 
beginning cursed the land, even 
so in the last days have I blessed 
it, in its time, for the use of my 
saints, that they may partake the 
fatness thereof. 



18. And now I give unto you a 
commandment that what I say 
unto one I say unto all, that yon 
shall forewarn your brethren con- 
cerning c these waters, that they 
come not in journeying upon 
them, lest their faith fail and 
they are caught in snares; 

19. I, the Lord, have decreed, 
and the destroyer rideth upon the 
face thereof, and I revoke not the 
decree. 

20. I, the Lord, was angry with 
you yesterday, but today mine 
anger is turned away. 

21. Wherefore, let those con- 
cerning whom I have spoken, 
that should take their journey 
in haste — again I say unto you, 
let them take their journey in 
haste. 

22. And it mattereth not unto 
me, after a little, if it so be that 
they fill their mission, whether 
they go by water or by land; let 
this be as it is made known unto 
them according to their judg- 
ments hereafter. 

23. And now, concerning my 
servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph 
Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, 
let them come not again upon the 
waters, save it be upon the 
canal, while journeying unto their 
homes; or in other words they 
shall not come upon the wa- 
ters to journey, save upon the 
canal. 

24. Behold, I, the Lord, have 
appointed a way for the journey- 
ing of my saints; and behold, this 
is the way — that after they leave 
the canal they shall journey by 
land, inasmuch as they are com- 
manded to journey and go up 
unto the land of Zion; 

25. And they shall do like unto 
the children of Israel, pitching 
their tents by the way. 

26. And, behold, this com-

mandment you shall give unto all 
your brethren. 

27. Nevertheless, unto whom 
is given power to command the 
waters, unto him it is given by 
the Spirit to know all his ways; 

28. Wherefore, let him do as 
the Spirit of the living God com- 
mandeth him, whether upon the 
land or upon the waters, as it 
remaineth with me to do here- 
after. 

29.. And unto you is given the 
course for the saints, or the way 
for the saints of the camp of the 
Lord, to journey. 

30. And again, verily I say 
unto you, my servants, Sidney 
Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and 
Oliver Cowdery, shall not open 
their mouths in the congregations 
of the wicked until they arrive at 
Cincinnati; 

31. And in that place they shall 
lift up their voices unto God 
against that people, yea unto him 
whose anger is kindled against 
their wickedness, a people who 
are well-nigh ripened for destruc- 
tion. 

32. And from thence let them 
journey for the congregations of 
their brethren, for their labors 
even now are wanted more abun- 
dantly among them than among 
the congregations of the wicked. 

33. And now, concerning the 



residue, let them journey and de- 
clare the word among the con- 
gregations of the wicked, inas- 
much as it is given; 

34. And inasmuch as they do 
this they shall rid their garments, 
and they shall be spotless before 
me. 

35. And let them journey to- 
gether, or d two by two, as seem- 
eth them good, only let my ser- 
vant Reynolds Cahoon, and my 
servant Samuel H. Smith, with 
whom I am well pleased, be not 
separated until they return to 
their homes, and this for a wise 
purpose in me. 

36. And now, verily I say unto 
you, and what I say unto one I 
say unto all, be of good cheer, 
little children; for I am in your 
midst, and I have not forsaken 
you; 

37. And inasmuch as you have 
humbled yourselves before me, 

1 the blessings of the e kingdom are 
yours. 

38. Gird up your loins and be 
watchful and be sober, looking 
forth for the 'coming of the Son 
of Man, for he cometh in an hour 
you think not. 

39. Pray always that you en- 
ter not into temptation, that you 
may abide the day of his coming, 
whether in life or in death. Even 
so. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, on the bank 
of the Missouri River, August 13, 1831. On this day the Prophet and 
his Counselors met several Elders who were on their way to the land 
of Zion, and, after joyful salutations, received this revelation to the 

encouragement of all. Labors of faithful Elders commended — 

Those on their way to Zion told of their prospective return in continua-

1. Behold, and hearken, O ye 
elders of my church, saith the 
Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, 
your °advocate, who knoweth the 
weakness of man and how to suc- 
cor them who are tempted. 

2. And verily mine eyes are 
upon those who have not as yet 
gone up unto the land of Zion; 
wherefore your mission is not yet 
full. 

3. Nevertheless, ye are blessed, 
for the testimony which ye have 
borne is recorded in heaven for 
the angels to look upon; and they 
rejoice over you, and your sins 
are forgiven you. 

4 . And now continue your jour- 
ney. Assemble yourselves upon 
the land of Zion; and hold a 
meeting and rejoice together, and 
offer a sacrament unto the Most 
High. 

5. And then you may return to 
bear record, yea, even altogether, 
or 'two by two, as seemeth you 
good, it mattereth not unto me; 



only be faithful, and declare glad 
tidings unto the inhabitants of 
the earth, or among the congre- 
gations of the wicked. 

6. Behold, I, the Lord, have 
brought you together that the 
promise might be fulfilled, that I 
the faithful among you should be ' 
preserved and rejoice together in 
the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, 
promise the faithful and cannot 
lie. 

7. I, the Lord, am willing, if 
any among you desire to ride 
upon horses, or upon mules, or 
in chariots, he shall receive this 
blessing, if he receive it from the 
hand of the Lord, with a thank- 
ful heart in all things. 

8. These things remain with 
you to do according to judgment 
and the directions of the Spirit. 

9. Behold, the d kingdom is 
yours. And behold, and lo, I am 
with the faithful always. Even 
so. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, August, 1831. Prefacing his record of this revelation the 
Prophet wrote: In these infant days of the Church, there was a great 
anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon every subject that in any 
way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the 
most important temporal object in view, I inquired of the Lord for 
further information upon the gathering of the Saints, and the purchase 
of the land, and other matters. See History of the Church, vol. 1, 

p. 207. Solemn warning to the wicked—Divine manifestations, 

and signs wrought by evil powers — Sin of adultery especially con- 
demned — Saints commanded to gather to Zion as they are able, hut 
not with undue haste lest confusion result — Lands to be secured by 
purchase and not by seizure — Blessed are they who die in the Lord— 
Condition of those who shall die during the Millennium — Sidney Rigdon 
rebuked for pride — Those who use the name of the Lord without 
authority declared to be under condemnation.

1. Hearken, O ye people, and 
open your hearts and give ear 
from afar; and listen, you that 
call yourselves the people of the 
Lord, and hear the word of the 
Lord and his will concerning 
you. 

2. Yea, verily, I say, hear the 
word of him whose anger is kin- 
dled against the wicked and re- 
bellious; 

3. Who willeth to take even 
them whom he will take, and pre- 
serveth in life them whom he will 
preserve; 

4. Who buildeth up at his own 
will and pleasure; and destroyeth 
when he pleases, and is able to 
cast the soul down to hell. 

5. Behold, I, the Lord, utter 
my voice, and it shall be obeyed. 

6. Wherefore, verily I say, let 
the wicked take heed, and let the 
rebellious fear and tremble; and 
let the unbelieving hold their 
lips, a for the day of wrath shall 
come upon them as a whirlwind, 
and all flesh shall know that I am 
God. 

7. And he that seeketh signs 
shall see signs, but not unto sal- 
vation. 

8. Verily, I say unto you, there 
are those among you who seek 
signs, and there have been such 
even from the beginning; 

9. But, behold, faith cometh 
not by signs, but signs follow 
those that believe. 

10. Yea, signs come by faith, 
not by the will of men, nor as 
they please, but by the will of 
God. 

11. Yea, signs come by faith, 
unto mighty works, for without 
faith no man pleaseth God; and 
with whom God is angry he is not 
well pleased; wherefore, unto 
such he showeth no signs, only 



in wrath unto their condemna- 
tion. 

12. Wherefore, I, the Lord, am 
not pleased with those among you 
who have sought after signs and 
wonders for faith, and not for the 
good of men unto my glory. 

13. Nevertheless, I give com- 
mandments, and many have 
turned away from my command- 
ments and have not kept them. 

14. There were among you 
"adulterers and adul tresses; some 
of whom have turned away from 
you, and others remain with you 
that hereafter shall be revealed. 

15. Let such beware and re- 
pent speedily, lest judgment shall 
come upon them as a snare, and 
their folly shall be made mani- 
fest, and their works shall follow 
them in the eyes of the people. 

16. And verily I say unto you, 
as I have said before, c he that 
looketh on a woman to lust after 
her, or if any shall commit adul- 
tery in their hearts, they shall 
not have the Spirit, but shall deny 
the faith and shall fear. 

17. Wherefore, I, the Lord, 
have d said that the fearful, and 
the unbelieving, and all liars, and 
whosoever loveth and maketh a 
lie, and the whoremonger, and 
the sorcerer, shall have their part 
in that lake which burneth with 
fire and brimstone, which is the 
second death. 

18. Verily I say, that they 
shall not have part in the 'first 
resurrection. 

19. And now behold, I, the 
Lord, say unto you that ye are 
not justified, because these things 
are among you. 

20. Nevertheless, he that en- 
dureth in faith and doeth my 
will, the same shall overcome, 
and shall receive an 'inheritance

upon the earth when the day of 
transfiguration shall come; 

21. When the earth shall be 
transfigured, even according to 
the pattern which was shown 
unto mine apostles upon the 
mount; of which account the ful- 
ness ye have not yet received. 

22. And now, verily I say unto 
you, that as I said that I would 
make known my will unto you, 
behold I will make it known unto 
you, not by the way of command- 
ment, for there are many who 
observe not to keep my command- 
ments. 

23. But unto him that keepeth 
my commandments I will give the 
'mysteries of my kingdom, and 
the same shall be in him a well 
of living water, springing up unto 
everlasting life. 

24. And now, behold, this is 
the will of the Lord your God 
concerning his saints, that they 
should assemble themselves to- 
gether unto the "land of Zion, not 
in haste, lest there should be con- 
fusion, which bringeth pestilence. 

25. Behold, the land of Zion — 
I, the Lord, hold it in mine own 
hands; 

26. Nevertheless, I, the Lord, 
render unto Caesar the things 
which are Caesar's. 

27. Wherefore, I the Lord will 
that you should 'purchase the 
lands, that you may have advan- 
tage of the world, that you may 
have claim on the world, that 
they may not be stirred up unto 
anger. 

28. For Satan putteth it into 
their hearts to anger against you, 
and to the shedding of blood. 

29. Wherefore, the land of 
Zion shall not be obtained but 
by 'purchase or by blood, other- 



wise there is none inheritance 
for you. 

30. And if by purchase, behold 
you are blessed; 

31. And if by blood, as you 
are forbidden to shed blood, lo, 
your enemies are upon you, and 
ye shall be scourged from city to 
city, and from synagogue to syna- 
gogue, and but *few shall stand 
to receive an inheritance. 

32. I, the Lord, am angry with 
the wicked; I am holding my 
Spirit from the inhabitants of the 
earth. 

33. I have sworn in my wrath, 
and 'decreed wars upon the face 
of the earth, and the wicked shall 
slay the wicked, and fear shall 
come upon every man; 

34. And the saints also shall 
hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the 
Lord, am with them, and will 
"come down in heaven from the 
presence of my Father and con- 
sume the wicked with "unquench- 
able fire. 

35. And behold, this is not yet, 
but by and by. 

36. Wherefore, seeing that I, 
the Lord, have decreed all these 
things upon the face of the earth, 
I will that my saints should be 
assembled upon the land of Zion; 

37. And that every man should 
take righteousness in his hands 
and faithfulness upon his loins, 
and lift a warning voice unto the 
inhabitants of the earth; and de- 
clare both by word and by flight 
that °desolation shall come upon 
the wicked. 

38. Wherefore, let my disciples 
in Kirtland arrange their tem- 
poral concerns, who dwell upon 
this farm.

those who shall go up unto 
id of Zion, and those of my 
es who shall tarry. 
Let my servant Newel K. 
3y retain his store, or in 
words, the store, yet for a 
season. 

Nevertheless, let him im- 
1 the money which he can 
, to be sent up unto the 
f Zion. 

Behold, these things are 
own hands, let him do ac- 
g to wisdom. 

Verily I say, let him be 
ed as an agent unto the 
es that shall tarry* and 
en be ordained unto this

And now speedily visit 
lurches, expounding these 
unto them, with my ser- 
Dliver Cowdery. Behold, 
my will, obtaining moneys 
,s I have directed. 
He that is faithful and en- 
shall overcome the world. 
He that 'sendeth up treas- 
nto the land of Zion shall 
&gt; an inheritance in this 
and his works shall fol- 



low him, and also a reward in the 
world to come. 

49. Yea, and blessed are the 
dead that die in the Lord, from 
henceforth, when the Lord shall 
come, and old things shall pass 
away, and all things become new, 
they shall r rise from the dead and 
shall not 'die after, and shall re- 
ceive an inheritance before the 
Lord, in the holy city. 

50. And he that liveth when 
the Lord shall come, and hath 
kept the faith, blessed is he; 
nevertheless, it is appointed to 
him to die at the age of man. 

51. Wherefore, children shall 
grow up until they become old; 
'old men shall die; but they shall 
not "sleep in the dust, but they 
shall be "changed in the twinkling 
of an eye. 

52. Wherefore, for this cause 
preached the apostles unto the 
world the resurrection of the 
dead. 

53. These things are the things 
that ye must look for ; and, speak- 
ing after the manner of the Lord, 
they are now nigh at hand, and 
in a time to come, even in the 
day of the * coming of the Son of 
Man. 

54. And until that hour there 
will be foolish virgins among the 
wise; and at that hour cometh 
an 'entire separation of the right- 
eous and the wicked ; and in that 
day will I send mine angels to 
'pluck out the wicked and cast 
them into unquenchable fire. 

55. And now behold, verily I 
say unto you, I, the Lord, am not 
pleased with my servant Sidney 
Rigdon ; he exalted himself in his 
heart, and received not counsel, 
but grieved the Spirit; 

56. Wherefore his writing is 
not acceptable unto the Lord, and

he shall make another; and if the 
Lord receive it not, behold he 
standeth no longer in the office to 
which I have appointed him. 

57. And again, verily I say 
unto you, those who desire in 
their hearts, in meekness, to warn 
sinners to repentance, let them be 
ordained unto this power. 

58. For this is a day of warn- 
ing, and not a day of many words. 
For I, the Lord, am not to be 
mocked in the last days. 

59. Behold, I am from above, 
and my power lieth beneath. I 
am over all, and in all, and 
through all, and search all things, 
and the day cometh that all things 
shall be subject unto me. 

60. Behold, I am Alpha and 
Omega, even Jesus Christ. 

61. Wherefore, let all men be- 
ware how they take my name in 
their lips — 

62. For behold, verily I say, 
that many there be who are un- 



der this condemnation, who use 
the name of the Lord, and use it 
in vain, having not authority. 

63. Wherefore, let the church 
repent of their sins, and I, the 
Lord, will own them; otherwise 
they shall be cut off. 

64. Remember that that which 
cometh from above is sacred, and 
must be spoken with care, and by 
constraint of the Spirit; and in 
this there is no condemnation, 
and ye 'receive the Spirit through 
prayer; wherefore, without this 
there remaineth condemnation. 

65. Let my servants, Joseph 
Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, 
seek them a home, as they are 
taught through prayer by the 
Spirit. 

66. These things remain to 
overcome through patience, that 
such may receive a more exceed- 
ing and eternal weight of glory, 
otherwise, a greater condemna- 
tion. Amen.

of the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, September 11, 1831. A company of 
brethren who had been commanded to journey to Zion were busily 

engaged in making preparations to leave in October. The Lord's 

rebuke to sinners — Forgiveness for the repentant sinner whose sin is 
not unto death — Forgive one another, and all men — Instruction to in- 
dividuals — The intervening time, until the coming of the Son of Man, 
called today — This a time of sacrifice and for the tithing of the people — 
The Saints warned against debt — Liars, hypocrites, and those who 
falsely pretend to be Apostles and Prophets to be exposed. 



1. Behold, thus saith the Lord 
jrour God unto you, O ye elders 
of my church, hearken ye and 
hear, and receive my will con- 
cerning you. 

2. For verily I say unto you, 
I will that ye should overcome 
the world; wherefore I will have 
compassion upon you. 



3. There are those among you 
who have sinned; but verily I 
say, for this once, for mine own 
glory, and for the salvation of 
souls, I have forgiven you your 
sins.

6. There are those who have 
sought occasion against him with- 
out cause; 

7. Nevertheless, he has sinned; 
but verily I say unto you, I, the 
Lord, forgive sins unto those who 
'confess their sins before me and 
ask forgiveness, who have not 
sinned unto death. 

8. My disciples, in days of old, 
sought occasion against one an- 
other and forgave not one an- 
other in their hearts; and for 
this evil they were afflicted and 
sorely chastened. 

9. Wherefore, I say unto you, 
that ye ought to forgive one an- 
other; for he that d forgiveth not 
his brother his trespasses stand- 
eth condemned before the Lord; 
for there remaineth in him the 
greater sin. 

10. I, the Lord, will "forgive 
whom I will forgive, but of you 
it is required to forgive all 
men. 

11. And ye ought to say in 
your hearts — let God judge be- 
tween me and thee, and reward 
thee according to thy deeds. 

12. And him that 'repenteth 
not of his sins, and confesseth 
them not, ye shall bring before 
the church, and do with him as 
the scripture saith unto you, 
either by commandment or by 
revelation. 

13. And this ye shall do that 
3od may be glorified — not be- 
cause ye forgive not, having not 
compassion, but that ye may be 



justified in the eyes of the law, 
that ye may not offend him who 
is your lawgiver — 

14. Verily I say, for this cause 
ye shall do these things. 

15. Behold, I, the Lord, was 
angry with him who was my ser- 
vant Ezra Booth, and also my ser- 
vant Isaac Morley, for they kept 
not the law, neither the com-r 
mandment; 

16. They sought evil in their 
hearts, and I, the Lord, withheld 
my Spirit. They condemned for 
evil that thing in which there was 
no evil; nevertheless I have for- 
given my servant Isaac Morley. 

17. And also my servant Ed- 
ward Partridge, behold, he hath 
sinned, and Satan seeketh to de- 
stroy his soul; but when these 
things are made known unto 
them, and they repent of the evil, 
they shall be forgiven. 

18. And now, verily I say that 
it is expedient in me that my ser- 
vant Sidney Gilbert, after a few 
weeks, shall return upon his busi- 
ness, and to his agency in the 
land of Zion; 

19. And that which he hath 
seen and heard may be made 
known unto my disciples, that 
they perish not. And for this 
cause have I spoken these things. 

20. And again, I say unto you, 
that my servant Isaac Morley may 
not be tempted above that which 
he is able to bear, and counsel 
wrongfully to your hurt, I gave 
commandment that his farm 
should be sold. 

21. I will not that my servant 
Frederick G. Williams should sell 
his farm, for I, the Lord, will to 
retain a strong hold in the land 
of Kirtland, for the space of five 
years, in the which I will not

overthrow the wicked, that there-

22. And after that day, I, the 
Lord, will not hold any guilty 
that shall go with an open heart 
up to the land of Zlon; for I, the 
Lord, require the hearts of the 
children of men. 

23. Behold, now it is called 
■today until the coming of the 
Bon ot Man, and verily it is a 
day of sacrifice, and a day for 
the tithing of my people; for he 
that is tithed shall not be burned 
at his coming. 

24. For after today Cometh the 
'burning — this is speaking after 
the manner of the Lord — for 
verily I say. tomorrow all the 
proud and they that do wickedly 
shall be as stubble; and I will 
burn them up, for I am the Lord 
of Hosts; and 1 will 'not spare any 
that remain In Babylon. 

25. Wherefore, if ye believe 
me, ye will labor while it is called 

26. And it is not meet that my 
servants, Newel K. Whitney and 
Sidney Gilbert, should sell their 
store and their possessions here; 
for this is not wisdom until the 
residue of the church, which re- 
malneth in this place, shall go up 
unto the land of Zion. 

27. Behold, it is said In my 
laws, or forbidden, to get In debt 
to thine enemies; 

28. But behold, it Is not said 
at any time that the Lord should 
not take when he please, and pay 
as seemeth him good. 

29. "Wherefore, as ye are 
agents, ye are on the Lord's er- 
rand; and whatever ye do accord- 
ing to the wilt of the Lord is the 
Lord's business. 



30. And he hath set you to 
provide for his saints In thesa 
last days, that they may obtain 
an inheritance In the land ot 
Zion. 

31. And behold, I, the Lord, 
declare unto you, and my words 
are sure and shall not fall, that 
they shall obtain it. 

32. But all things must coma 
to pass in their time. 

33. Wherefore, be not weary 
In well-doing, for ye are laying 
the 'foundation of a great work. 
And out of small things proeeed- 
eth that which is great. 

34. Behold, the Lord regulreth 
the heart and a willing mind; 
and the 'willing and obedient 
shall eat the good of the land of 
Zion in these last days. 

35. And the rebellious shall be 
cut off out of the land of Zion, 
and shall be 'sent away, and shall 
not inherit the laud. 

36. For, verily I say that the 
rebellious are "not of the blood 
ot Ephraim, wherefore they shall 
be plucked out. 

37. Behold, I, the Lord, have 
made "my church In these last 
days like unto a Judge sitting on 
a bill, or in a "high place, to 
Judge the nations. 

38. For it shall come to pass 
that the inhabitants of Zlon shall 
Judge all things pertaining to 
Zion. 

39. And liars and hypocrites 
shall be proved by them, and they 
who are not apostles and prophets 
shall be known. 

40. And even the bishop, wio 
is a judge, and his counselors, if 
they are not faithful in their 
stewardships shall he condemned^

'glory of the Lord shall be upon 
her;

come unto her out of every nation

SECTION 65. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, 
Ohio, October, 1831. ,The Prophet designates this revelation as a 

prayer. Commitment of the keys of the kingdom of God unto 

man — The kingdom of God and ihe kingdom of Heaven named 
separately — Supplication that the kingdom of God, already on earth, 
may go forth that the kingdom of Heaven may come. 



1. Hearken, and lo, a voice as 
of one sent down from on high, 
who is mighty and powerful, 
whose going forth is unto the 
ends of the earth, yea, whose 
voice is unto men — "Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord, make his 
paths straight. 

2. The *keys of the kingdom of 
God are committed unto man on 
the earth, and from thence shall 
the gospel roll forth unto the 
ends of the earth, as the e stone 
which is cut out of the mountain 
without hands shall roll forth, 
until it has filled the whole earth. 

3. Yea, a voice crying — d Pre- 
pare ye the way of the Lord, pre- 
pare, ye the supper of the Lamb, 
make ready for the Bridegroom. 

4. Pray unto the Lord, call 



upon his holy name, make known 
'his wonderful works among the 
people. 

5. Call upon the Lord, that his 
kingdom may go forth upon the 
earth, that the inhabitants there- 
of may receive it, and be prepared 
for the days to come, in the which 
the Son of Man shall come 'down 
in heaven, clothed in the bright- 
ness of his glory, to meet the 
kingdom of God which is "set up 
on the earth. 

6. Wherefore, may the *king- 
dom of God go forth, that the 
kingdom of heaven may come, 
that thou, O God, mayest be glori- 
fied in heaven so on earth, that 
thine enemies may be subdued; 
for thine is the honor, power and 
glory, forever and ever. Amen.

tion — Warning against personal weaknesses and liability to specific 
temptation — Great achievements in righteousness, with consequent bless- 
ings, predicted on condition of devotion to the work of the ministry. 



1. Behold, thus saith the Lord 
unto my servant William E. 
M'Lellin — Blessed are you, inas- 
much as you have turned away 
from your iniquities, and have re- 
ceived my truths, saith the Lord 
your Redeemer, the Savior of the 
world, even of as many as believe 
on my name. 

2. Verily I say unto you, blessed 
are you for receiving mine "ever- 
lasting covenant, even the *ful- 
ness of my gospel, sent forth unto 
the children of men, that they 
might have life and be made par- 
takers of the glories which are to 
be revealed in the last days, as 
it was written by the prophets 
and apostles in days of old. 

3. Verily I say unto you, my 
servant William, that you are 
clean, but not all; repent, there- 
fore, of those things which are 
not pleasing in my sight, saith 
the Lord, for the Lord will show 
them unto you. 

4. And now, verily, I, the Lord, 
will show unto you what I will 
concerning you, or what is my 
will concerning you. 

5. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, that it is my will that you 
should proclaim my gospel from 
land to land, and from city to 
city, yea, in those regions round 
about where it has not been pro- 
claimed. 

6. Tarry not many days in this 
place; go not up unto the land of 
Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you 



can send, send; otherwise, think 
not of thy property. 

7. Go unto the eastern lands, 
bear testimony in every place, 
unto every people and in their 
synagogues, reasoning with the 
people. 

8. Let my servant Samuel H. 
Smith go with you, and forsake 
him not, and give him thine in- 
structions; and he that is faith- 
ful shall be made strong in every 
place; and I, the Lord, will go 
with you. 

9. c Lay your hands upon the 
sick, and they shall recover. Re- 
turn not till I, the Lord, shall send 
you. Be patient in affliction. 
Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, 
and it shall be opened unto 
you. 

10. Seek not to be cumbered. 
Forsake all unrighteousness. 
Commit not "adultery — a tempta- 
tion with which thou hast been 
troubled. 

11. Keep these sayings, for 
they are true and faithful; and 
thou shalt magnify thine office, 
and push many people to Zion 
with songs of everlasting joy upon 
their heads. 

12. Continue in these things 
'even unto the end, and you shall 
have a crown of eternal life at 
the right hand of my Father, who 
is full of grace and truth. 

13. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
your God, your Redeemer, even 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

SECTION 67. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, 
Ohio, November, 1831. The occasion was that of a special conference, 
md the publication of the revelations already received from the Lord 
hrough Joseph Smith the Prophet was considered and acted upon, 
lee heading to Section 1. Many of the brethren bore solemn testimony 
hat the revelations then compiled for publication are verily true as 
'as witnessed unto them by the Holy Ghost shed forth upon them. 
'he Prophet records that after the revelation known as Section 1 had 
een received, some conversation was had concerning revelations and 

mguage. The present revelation followed. The Lord affirms the 

-uth of the commandments — Secret ambitions of some there present 
&gt; express themselves in language superior to that of the revelations 
cposed — The Lord's challenge to even the wisest to imitate the least 
f the revelations. 



1. Behold and hearken, O ye 
Lders of my church, who have 
isembled yourselves together, 
hose prayers I have heard, and 
hose hearts I know, and whose 
esires have come up before me. 

2. Behold and lo, mine eyes 
re upon you, and the heavens 
ad the earth are in mine hands, 
nd the riches of eternity are 
line to give. 

3. Ye endeavored to believe 
dat ye should receive the bless- 
ig which was offered unto you; 
ut behold, verily I say unto you 
here were fears in your hearts, 
nd verily this is the reason that 
e did not receive. 

4. And now I, the Lord, give 
nto you a testimony of the truth 
f these commandments which 
.re lying before you. 

5. Your eyes have been upon 
ny servant Joseph Smith, Jun., 
nd his language you have known, 
ind his imperfections you have 
mown; and you have sought in 
'our hearts knowledge that you 
night express beyond his lan- 
guage; this you also know. 

6. Now, seek ye out of the 



Book of Commandments, even the 
least that is among them, and ap- 
point him that is the most wise 
among you; 

7. Or, if there be any among 
you that shall make one like unto 
it, then ye are justified in saying 
that ye do not know that they are 
true; 

8. But if ye cannot make one 
like unto it, ye are under con- 
demnation if ye do not bear rec- 
ord that they are true. 

9. For ye know that there is 
a no unrighteousness in them, and 
that which is righteous cometh 
down from above, from the Fa- 
ther of lights. 

10. And again, verily I say 
unto you that it is your privilege, 
and a promise I give unto you 
that have been ordained unto this 
ministry, that inasmuch as you 
strip yourselves from jealousies 
and fears, and humble yourselves 
before me, for ye are not suffi- 
ciently humble, the veil shall be 
rent and you shall "see me and 
know that I am — not with the 
carnal neither natural mind, but 
with the spiritual.

11. For 'no man has seen God 
at any time in the flesh, except 
quickened by the Spirit of God. 

12. Neither can any natural 
man abide the presence of God, 
neither after the carnal mind. 

13. Ye are not able to abide 
the presence of God now, neither 
the ministering of angels; where- 



fore, continue in patience until 
ye are perfected. 

14. Let not your minds tarn 
back; and when ye are worthy, 
in mine own due time, ye shall 
see and know that which was con- 
ferred upon you by the hands of 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jun. 
Amen. 



SECTION 68. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, 
Ohio, November, 1831, concerning Orson Hyde, Luke S. Johnson, 
Lyman E. Johnson, and William E. WLellin. This was given in 
response to supplication that the mind of the Lord be made known 

concerning the Elders named. Utterances of men ordained to 

the Holy Priesthood when they speak as moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost designated as Scripture — Ordination of additional Bishops fore- 
shadowed — Right of literal descendants of Aaron — High Priests may 
be ordained Bishops — Duties of parents respecting their children, par- 
ticularly as to the teaching of the principles of the Gospel — Observance 
of the Sabbath as a holy day — Idleness and greed for worldly things 
condemned. 



1. My servant, Orson Hyde, 
was called by his ordination to 
proclaim the Everlasting gospel, 
by the Spirit of the living God, 
from people to people, and from 
land to land, in the congregations 
of the wicked, in their syna- 
gogues, reasoning with and ex- 
pounding all scriptures unto them. 

2. And, behold, and lo, this is 
an ensample unto all those who 
were ordained unto this priest- 
hood, whose mission is appointed 
unto them to go forth — 

3. And this is the ensample 
unto them, that they shall speak 
as they are 6 moved upon by the 
Holy Ghost. 

4. And whatsoever they shall 
speak when moved upon by the 
Holy Ghost shall be scripture, 



shall be the will of the Lord, shall 
be the mind of the Lord, shall be 
the word of the Lord, shall be the 
voice of the Lord, and the power 
of God unto salvation. 

5. Behold, this is the promise 
of the Lord unto you, O ye my 
servants. 

6. Wherefore, be of good cheer, 
and do not fear, for I the Lord 
am with you, and will stand by 
you; and ye shall bear record of 
me, even Jesus Christ, that I am 
the Son of the living God, that I 
was, that I am, and that I am to 
come. 

7. This is the word of the Lord 
unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, 
and also unto my servant Luke 
Johnson, and unto my servant Ly- 
man Johnson, and unto my ser-

Ill 



vant William E. M'Lellin, and 
unto all the faithful elders of my 
church — 

8. c Go ye into all the world, 
preach the gospel to every crea- 
ture, acting in the authority 
which I have given you, 'baptiz- 
ing in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. 

9. And he that believeth and 
is baptized shall be saved, and 
he that believeth 'not shall be 
damned. 

10. And he that believeth shall 
be blest with signs following, even 
as it is written. 

11. And unto you it shall be 
given to know the signs of the 
times, and the "signs of the com- 
ing of the Son of Man; 

12. And of as many as the Fa- 
ther shall bear record, to you 
shall be given power to "seal them 
up unto eternal life. Amen. 

13. And now, concerning the 
items in addition to the cove- 
nants and commandments, they 
are these — 

14. There remain hereafter, 
in the due time of the Lord, other 
bishops to be set apart unto the 
church, to minister even accord- 
ing to the first; 

15. Wherefore they shall be 
♦high priests who are worthy, and 
they shall be appointed by the 
'First Presidency of the Melchize- 
dek Priesthood, except they be 
literal descendants of Aaron. 

16. And if they be 'literal de- 
scendants of Aaron they have a 



legal right to the bishopric, if 
they are the 'firstborn among the 
sons of Aaron; 

17. For the firstborn holds the 
right of the presidency over this 
priesthood, and the m keys or 
authority of the same. 

18. No man has a legal right 
to this office, to hold the keys of 
this priesthood, except he be a 
"literal descendant and the first- 
born of Aaron. 

19. But, as a 'high priest of the 
Melchizedek Priesthood has au- 
thority to officiate in all the lesser 
offices he may officiate in the office 
of bishop when no literal descen- 
dant of Aaron can be found, pro- 
vided he is called and set apart 
and ordained unto this power, un- 
der the hands of the 'First Presi- 
dency of the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood. 

20. And a 'literal descendant 
of Aaron, also, must be desig- 
nated by this 'Presidency, and 
found worthy, and 'anointed, and 
ordained under the hands of this 
Presidency, otherwise they are 
not legally authorized to officiate 
in their priesthood. 

21. But, by virtue of the decree 
concerning their right of the 
priesthood descending from fa- 
ther to son, they may claim their 
'anointing if at any time they 
can prove their lineage, or do as- 
certain it by revelation from the 
Lord "under the hands of the 
above named Presidency. 

22. And again, no bishop or 
high priest who shall be set apart

the heads of the parents. 

26. For this shall be a law 
unto the inhabitants of Zion, or 
in any of her stakes which are 
organized. 

27. And their children shall be 
baptized for the remission of their 
sins when 'eight years old, and 
receive the laying on of the 
hands. 

28. And they shall also 2a teach 
their children to pray, and to 
walk uprightly before the Lord. 



29. And the inhabitants of 
Zion shall also observe the Sab- 
bath day to keep it holy. 

30. And the inhabitants of 
Zion also shall remember their 
2c labors, inasmuch as they are 
appointed to labor, in all faith- 
fulness; for the 2d idler shall be 
had in remembrance before the 
Lord. 

31. Now, I, the Lord, am not 
well pleased with the inhabitants 
of Zion, for there are idlers 
among them; and their children 
are also growing up in wicked- 
ness; they also seek not ear- 
nestly the 2e riches of eternity, but 
their eyes are full of greediness. 

32. These things ought not to 
be, and must be done away from 
among them; wherefore, let my 
servant Oliver Cowdery carry 
these sayings unto the land of 
Zion. 

33. And a commandment I 
give unto them — that he that ob- 
serveth not his Sprayers before 
the Lord in the season thereof, 
let him be had in remembrance 
before the judge of my people. 

34. These sayings are true and 
faithful ; wherefore, transgress 
them not, neither take therefrom. 

35. Behold, I am 2 " Alpha and 
Omega, and I 2A come quickly. 
Amen.

1. Hearken unto me, saith the 
Lord your God, for my servant 
Dliver Cowdery's sake. It is not

entrusted with the command- 
ments and the moneys which he 
shall carry unto the land of Zion, 
3xcept one go with him who will 
be true and faithful. 

2. Wherefore, I, the Lord, will 
that my servant, John Whitmer, 
should go with my servant Oliver 
Cowdery; 

3. And also that he shall con- 
tinue in writing and making a 
•history of all the important 
things which he shall observe and 
know concerning my 6 church; 

4. And also that he receive 
counsel and assistance from my 
servant Oliver Cowdery and 
others. 

5. And also, my servants who 



are abroad in the earth should 
send forth the accounts of their 
'stewardships to the land of 
Zion; 

6. For the land of Zion shall 
be a seat and a place to receive 
and do all these things. 

7. Nevertheless, let my ser- 
vant John Whitmer travel many 
times from place to place, and 
from church to church, that he 
may the more easily obtain 
knowledge — 

8. Preaching and expounding, 
writing, copying, selecting, and 
obtaining all things which shall 
be for the good of the church, 
and for the rising generations 
that shall grow up on the land 
of Zion, to possess it from gen- 
eration to generation, 'forever

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, November, 1831. The documentary history written by the 
Prophet states that four special conferences were held from the 1st 
to the 12th of November, inclusive. In the last of these assemblies 
the great importance of the Book of Commandments, later called the 
Doctrine and Covenants, was considered; and the Prophet refers to 
it as being the foundation of the Church in these last days, and a 
benefit to the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries of the 
kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to man. See History of

unto my servant Sidney Rlgdon, 
and also unto my servant William

2. For I give unto them a com-

and hear, for thus saith the Lord 

3. I, the Lord, have appointed 
them, and ordained them to be 
"stewards over the revelations 
and commandments which I have

shall hereafter give unto them; 

4. And an account of this

Lord requires of every man in his

have appointed or shall hereafter 
appoint unto any man. 

10. And behold, 'none are

neither the "agent who keepeth

who is appointed in a steward-

they shall enter into the joy of

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, 
at Hiram, Ohio, December 1, 1831. The Prophet had resumed the 
translation of the Scriptures with Sidney Rigdon as his scribe; and 
the two so labored until this revelation was received. Circum- 
stances of the times required that the two devote themselves to travel 
and preaching for a season — To meet the opponents of the Church, 
both in public and in private — To bear testimony of the command- 
ments that have been received and in preparation for others yet to come.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, December 4, 1831. Several Elders and members had assembled 
to learn their duty and to be further edified in the teachings of the 

Church. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 239. The need 

of another Bishop being appointed, he to attend to the affairs pertain- 
ing to the Bishopric in the eastern branches — His records to be delivered 
to the Bishop in Zion — Newel K. Whitney named as the second Bishop 
to be ordained in the Church — Duties of the Bishop enlarged upon— 
Certificates of membership provided for. 



1. Hearken, and listen to the 
voice of the Lord, O ye who have 
assembled yourselves together, 
who are the "high priests of my 
church, to whom the ^kingdom 
and power have been given. 

2. For verily thus saith the 
Lord, it is expedient in me for a 
c bishop to be appointed unto you, 
or of you, unto the church in this 
part of the Lord's vineyard. 

3. And verily in this thing ye 
have done wisely, for it is re- 
quired of the Lord, at the hand 
of "every steward, to render an 
account of his stewardship, both 
in time and in eternity. 

4. For he who is faithful and 
wise in time is accounted worthy 
to inherit the 'mansions prepared 
for him of my Father. 

5. Verily I say unto you, the 
elders of the church in this part 
of my vineyard shall render an 
'account of their stewardship 
unto the bishop, who shall be 
appointed of me in this part of 
my vineyard. 

6. These things shall be had 
on record, to be handed over unto 
the bishop in Zion. 

7. And the duty of the bishop 
shall be made known by the com- 
mandments which have been 
given, and the voice of the con- 
ference. 



8. And now, verily I say unto 
you, my servant Newel K. Whit- 
ney is the man who shall be ap- 
pointed and ordained unto this 
power. This is the will of the 
Lord your God, your Redeemer. 
Even so. Amen. 

9. The word of the Lord, in 
addition to the law which has 
been given, making known the 
duty of the bishop who has been 
ordained unto the church in this 
part of the vineyard, which is 
verily this — 

10. To keep the Lord's 'store- 
house; to receive the "funds of 
the church in this part of the 
vineyard; 

11. To take an *account of the 
elders as before has been com- 
manded; and to administer to 
their wants, who shall pay for 
that which they receive, inas- 
much as they have wherewith to 
pay; 

12. That this also may be con- 
secrated to the good of the 
church, to the poor and needy. 

13. And he who hath not 
wherewith to pay, an account 
shall be taken and handed over 
to the bishop of Zion, who shall 
pay the debt out of that which 
the Lord shall put into his hands.

SECTION 74. 



By Revelation to Joseph Smith the Prophet, this explanation of 
the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 7, verse 14, was 
given, at Hiram, Ohio, January, 1832, 



1. For the unbelieving hus- 
band is sanctified by the wife, 
and the unbelieving wife is sanc- 
tified by the husband; else were 
your children unclean, but now 
•are they holy. 

2. Now, in the days of the 
apostles the law of circumcision 
was had among all the Jews who 
believed not the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

3. And it came to pass that 
there arose a great contention 
among the people concerning the 
law of circumcision, for the un- 
believing husband was desirous 
that his children should be cir- 
cumcised and become subject to 
the law of Moses, which law was 
fulfilled. 

4. And it came to pass that the 
children, being brought up in sub- 
jection to the law of Moses, gave 



heed to the traditions of their fa- 
thers and believed not the gospel 
of Christ, wherein they became 
unholy. 

5 . Wherefore, for this cause tbe 
apostle wrote unto the church, 
giving unto them a command- 
ment, not of the Lord, but of him- 
self, that a believer should not 
be united to an unbeliever; ex- 
cept the law of Moses should be 
done away among them, 

6. That their children migbt 
remain without circumcision; and 
that the tradition might be done 
away, which saith that little chil- 
dren are unholy; for it was had 
among the Jews; 

7. But kittle children are 
holy, being sanctified through tbe 
atonement of Jesus Christ; and 
this is what the scriptures mean.

SECTION 75. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Amherst, 
Ohio, January 25, 1832. The occasion was that of a conference before 
appointed. Certain Elders, who had encountered difficulty in bringing 
men to an understanding of their message, desired to learn more in 
detail as to their immediate duties. This revelation followed. See 

History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 242. Instructions for individual 

guidance of Elders who are to travel two by two — Necessity of con- 
stant prayer and unwavering faith — Directions for the care and sup- 
port of the families of absent Elders. 



1. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, I who speak even by the 
voice of my Spirit, even Alpha 
and Omega, your Lord and your 
God— 

2. Hearken, O ye who have 
given your names to go forth to 
proclaim my gospel, and to prune 
my vineyard. 

3. Behold, I say unto you that 
it is my will that you should go 
forth and not tarry, neither be 
•idle but labor with your might — 

4. Lifting up your voices as 
with the sound of a trump, pro- 
claiming the truth according to 
the revelations and command- 
ments which I have given you. 

5. And thus, if ye are faithful 
ye shall be *laden with many 
sheaves, and crowned with honor, 
and glory, and immortality, and 
eternal life. 

6. Therefore, verily I say unto 
my servant William E. M'Lellin, 
I c revoke the commission which 
I gave unto him to go unto the 
eastern countries; 

7. And I give unto him a tf new 
commission and a new command- 
ment, in the which I, the Lord, 
chasten him for the murmurings 
of his heart; 

8. And he sinned; neverthe- 
less, I forgive him and say unto 
him again, Go ye into the south 
countries. 



9. And let my servant Luke 
Johnson go with him, and pro- 
claim the things which I have 
commanded them — 

10. Calling on the name of the 
Lord for the 'Comforter, which 
shall teach them all things that 
are expedient for them — 

11. Praying always that they 
faint not; and inasmuch as they 
do this, I will be with them even 
unto the end. 

12. Behold, this is the will of 
the Lord your God concerning 
you. Even so. Amen. 

13. And again, verily thus 
saith the Lord, let my servant 
Orson Hyde and my servant Sam- 
uel H. Smith take their journey 
into the eastern countries, and 
proclaim the things which I have 
commanded them; and inasmuch 
as they are faithful, lo, I will be 
with them even unto the end. 

14. And again, verily I say 
unto my servant Lyman Johnson, 
and unto my servant Orson Pratt, 
they shall also take their journey 
into the eastern countries; and 
behold, and lo, I am with them 
also, even unto the end. 

15. And again, I say unto my 
servant Asa Dodds, and unto my 
servant Calves Wilson, that they 
also shall take their journey unto 
the western countries, and pro-

claim my gospel, even as I have 
commanded them. 

16. And he who is faithful 
shall overcome all things, and 
shall be 'lifted up at the last day. 

17. And again, I say unto my 
servant Major N. Ashley, and my 
servant Burr Riggs, let them take 
their journey also into the south 
country. 

18. Yea, let all those take their 
journey, as I have commanded 
them, going from house to house, 
and from village to village, and 
from city to city. 

19. And in whatsoever house 
ye enter, and they receive you, 
'leave your blessing upon that 
house. 

20. And in whatsoever house 
ye enter, and they receive you 
not, ye shall depart speedily from 
that house, and "shake off the 
dust of your feet as a testimony 
against them. 

21. And you shall be filled with 
joy and gladness; and know this, 
that in the day of judgment you 
shall be fudges of that house, 
and condemn them; 

22. And it shall be more toler- 
able for the heathen in the day 
of judgment, than for that house; 
therefore, gird up your loins and 
be faithful, and ye shall over- 
come all things, and be 'lifted up 
at the last day. Even so. Amen. 

23. And again, thus saith the 
Lord unto you, O ye elders of my 
church, who have given your 
names that you might know his 
will concerning you — 

24. Behold, I say unto you, 
that it is the *duty of the church 
to assist in supporting the fam- 
ilies of those, and also to sup- 
port the families of those who 
are called and must needs be sent 



unto the world to proclaim the 
gospel unto the world. 

25. Wherefore, I, the Lord, 
give unto you this commandment, 
that ye obtain places for your 
families, inasmuch as your breth- 
ren are willing to open their 
hearts. 

26. And let all such as can 
obtain places for their families, 
and support of the church for

shall receive, knock and it shall 
be opened unto them, and be 
made known from on high, even 
by the m Comforter, whither they 
shall go. 

28. And again, verily I say 
unto you, that every man who is 
obliged to provide for his own 
family, let him provide, and he 
shall in nowise lose his crown; 
and let him labor in the church. 

29. Let every man be diligent 
in all things. And the "idler shall 
not have place in the church, ex- 
cept he repent and mend his 
ways.

A Vision, given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Sidney Bigdon, 
at Hiram, Ohio, February 16, 1832. Prefacing his record of this 
vision the Prophet wrote: "From sundry revelations which had been 
received, it was apparent that many important points touching the 
salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was 
compiled. It appeared self -evident from what truths were left, that 
if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body, 
the term Heaven, as intended for the Saints' eternal home, must include 
more kingdoms than one." While he and Sidney Bigdon were engaged 
in studious and doubtless prayerful consideration of this matter, the 
glorious vision here recorded was given them* See History of the 
Church, vol. 1, p. 245. Bevelation of truth, wisdom, and even mys- 
teries promised unto those who are worthy — The eventual resurrection 
of both just and unjust — The two Elders bear solemn personal testi- 
mony that Jesus Christ lives — The expulsion of Lucifer, and his evil 
activities as Satan on the earth — Awful fate of those who become 
sons' of perdition — Distinctive glories of the celestial, the terrestrial, 
and the telestial states — Qualifications of souls that shall be assigned to 
each — Glorious consummation of the Savior's work. 



1. Hear, O ye heavens, and 
give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye 
inhabitants thereof, for the Lord 
is God, and beside him there is 
no Savior. 

2. Great is his wisdom, mar- 
velous are his ways, and the ex- 
tent of his doings none can find 
out. 

3. His purposes fail not, nei- 
ther are there any who can stay 
his hand. 

4. From "eternity to eternity 
he is the same, and his years 
never fail. 

5. For thus saith the Lord — I, 
the Lord, am merciful and gra- 
cious unto those who fear me, 
and delight to honor those who 
serve me in righteousness and in 
truth unto the end.

6. Great shall be their reward 
and eternal shall be their glory. 

7. And to them will I reveal 
*all mysteries, yea, all the hidden 
mysteries of my kingdom from 
days of old, and for ages to come, 
will I make known unto them the 
good pleasure of my will concern- 
ing all things pertaining to my 
kingdom. 

8. Yea, even the 'wonders of 
eternity shall they know, and 
things to come will I show them, 
even the things of many genera- 
tions. 

9. And their wisdom shall be 
great, and their understanding 
reach to heaven ; and before them 
the wisdom of the wise shall 
perish, and the understanding of 
the prudent shall come to naught.

10. For by my Spirit will I en- 
lighten them, and by my power 
will I make known unto them the 
secrets of my will — yea, even 
those things which "eye has not 
seen, nor ear heard, nor yet en- 
tered into the heart of man. 

11. We, Joseph Smith, Jun., 
and Sidney Rigdon, being in the 
Spirit on the sixteenth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord 
one thousand eight hundred and 
thirty-two — 

12. By the power of the Spirit 
our eyes were opened and our 
understandings were enlightened, 
so as to see and understand the 
things of God — 

13. Even those things which 
were from the beginning before 
the world was, which were or- 
dained of the Father, through his 
Only Begotten Son, who was in 
the bosom of the Father, even 
from the beginning; 

14. Of whom we bear record; 
and the record which we bear is 
the 'fulness of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, who is the Son, 
whom we 'saw and with whom 
we conversed in the heavenly 
vision. 

15. For while we were doing 
the work of translation, which 
the Lord had appointed unto us, 
we came to the twenty-ninth 
verse of the fifth chapter of John, 
which was given unto us as fol- 
lows: 

16. Speaking of the resurrec- 
tion of the dead, concerning those 
who shall hear the voice of the 
Son of Man, and shall come 
forth — 

17. They who have done good 
in the ^resurrection of the just, 
and they who have done evil in 



the resurrection of the unjust — 

18. Now this caused us to mar- 
vel, for it was given unto us of 
the Spirit. 

19. And while we meditated 
upon these things, the Lord 
touched the eyes of our under- 
standings and they were opened, 
and the glory of the Lord shone 
round about. 

20. And we 'beheld the glory 
of the Son, on the right hand of 
the Father, and received of his 
fulness; 

21. And 'saw the holy angels, 
and them who are sanctified be- 
fore his throne, worshiping God, 
and the Lamb, who worship him 
forever and ever. 

22. And now, after the many 
testimonies which have been 
given of him, this is the 'testi- 
mony, last of all, which we give 
of him: That he lives! 

23. For we 'saw him, even on 
the right hand of God; and we 
heard the voice bearing record 
that he is the Only Begotten of 
the Father — 

24. That by him, and through 
him, and of him, m the worlds are 
and were created, and the in- 
habitants thereof are begotten 
sons and daughters unto God. 

25. And this we saw also, and 
bear record, that an "angel of 
God who was in authority in the 
presence of God, who rebelled 
against the Only Begotten Son 
whom the Father loved and who 
was in the bosom of the Father, 
was thrust down from the pres- 
ence of God and the Son, 

26. And was called "Perdition, 
for the heavens wept over him — 
he was 'Lucifer, a son of the 
morning. ,

27. And we beheld, and lo, he 
is fallen ! is fallen, even a son of 
the morning! 

28. And while we were yet in 
the Spirit, the Lord commanded 
us that we should write the 
vision; for we «beheld Satan, that 
old serpent, even the devil, who 
rebelled against God, and sought 
to take the kingdom of our God 
and his Christ — 

29. Wherefore, he maketh war 
with the saints of God, and en- 
compasseth them round about. 

30. And we saw a r vision of 
the sufferings of those with whom 
he made war and overcame, for 
thus came the voice of the Lord 
unto us: 

31. Thus saith the Lord con- 
cerning all those who know my 
power, and have been made par- 
takers thereof, and suffered them- 
selves through the power of the 
devil to be overcome, and to deny 
the truth and defy my power — 

32. They are they who are the 
'sons of perdition, of- whom I say 
that it had been better for them 
never to have been born; 

33. For they are vessels of 
wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath 
of God, with the devil and his 
angels in eternity; 

34. Concerning whom I have 
said there is 'no forgiveness in 
this world nor in the world to 
come — 

35. Having "denied the Holy 
Spirit after having received it, 
and having denied the Only Be- 
gotten Son of the Father, having 
crucified him unto themselves and 
put him to an open shame. 

36. These are they who shall 
go away into the v lake of fire and 



brimstone, with the devil and his 
angels — 

37. And the "only ones on 
whom the second death shall 
have any power; 

38. Yea, verily, the only ones 
who shall not be redeemed in 
the due time of the Lord, after 
the sufferings of his wrath. 

39. For 'all the rest shall be 
brought forth by the resurrec- 
tion of the dead, through the 
triumph and the glory of the 
Lamb, who was slain, who was 
in the bosom of the Father 'be- 
fore the worlds were made. 

40. And this is the gospel, the 
glad tidings, which the voice out 
of the heavens bore record unto 
us — 

41. That he came into the 
world, even Jesus, to be crucified 
for the world, and to bear the 
sins of the world, and to sanctify 
the world, and to cleanse it from 
all unrighteousness; 

42. That through him all might 
be saved whom the Father had 
put into his power and made by 
him; 

43. Who glorifies the Father, 
and saves all the works of his 
hands, except those 'sons of per- 
dition who deny the Son after the 
Father has revealed him. 

44. Wherefore, he saves all ex- 
cept them — they shall go away 
into 2a everlasting punishment, 
which is endless punishment, 
which is eternal punishment, to 
reign with the devil and his an- 
gels in eternity, where their 
"worm dieth not, and the fire is 
not quenohed, which is their tor- 
ment — 

45. And the end thereof, nei-

ther the place thereof, nor their 
torment, no man knows; 

46. Neither was it revealed, 
neither is, neither will be revealed 
unto man, except to them who are 
made partakers thereof; 

47. Nevertheless, I, the Lord, 
show it by vision unto many, but 
straightway shut it up again; 

48. Wherefore, the end, the 
width, the height, the depth, and 
the misery thereof, they under- 
stand not, neither any man ex- 
cept those who are 2(? ordained 
unto this condemnation. 

49. And we heard the voice, 
saying: Write the vision, for lo, 
this is the end of the vision of 
the sufferings of the ungodly. 

50. And again we bear record 
— for we saw and heard, and this 
is the testimony of the gospel of 
Christ concerning them who shall 
come forth in the 2d resurrection 
of the just — 

51. They are they who re- 
ceived the testimony of Jesus, 
and 2e believed on his name and 
were baptized after the manner 
of his burial, being 2 'buried in 
the water in his name, and this 
according to the commandment 
which he has given — 

52. That by keeping the com- 
mandments they might be washed 
and cleansed from all their sins, 
and receive the Holy Spirit by 
the laying on of the hands of 
him who is ordained and sealed 
unto this power; 

53. And who overcome by 
faith, and are 2 'sealed by the 
Holy Spirit of promise, which the 
Father sheds forth upon all those 
who are just and true. 



54. They are they who are the 
2 *church of the Firstborn. 

55. They are they into whose 
hands the Father has given "all 
things — 

56. They are they who are 
2i priests and kings, who have re- 
ceived of his fulness, and of his 
glory; 

57. And are priests of the 
Most High, after the order of 
Melchizedek, which was after the 
order of Enoch, which was after 
the order of the Only Begotten 
Son. 

58. Wherefore, as it is written, 
2 *they are gods, even the sons of 
God — 

59. Wherefore, a, all things are v 
theirs, whether life or death, 
or things present, or things to 
come, all are theirs and they are 
Christ's, and Christ is God's. 

60. And they shall overcome 
all things. 

61. Wherefore, let no man 
glory in man, but rather let him 
glory in God, who shall subdue 
all enemies under his feet. 

62. These shall dwell in the 
2m presence of God and his Christ 
forever and ever.

shall come in the clouds of heav- 
en to reign on the earth over his

all. 

67. These are they who have 
come to an innumerable company 
of angels, to the general assem- 
bly and church of Enoch, and o£ 
the Firstborn. 

68. These are they whose 
names are written In heaven, 
■where God and Christ are the 
judge of all. 

69. These are they who are 
just men made perfect through 
Jesus the mediator of the "new 
covenant, who wrought out this 
perfect atonement through the 
shedding of his own blood. 

70. These are they whose 
''bodies are celestial, whose glory 
Is that of the sun, even the glory 
of Qod, the highest of all. whose 
glory the "sun of the firmament 
Is written of as being typical. 

71. And again, we saw the 
"terrestrial world, and behold 
and lo, these are they who are of 
the terrestrial, whose glory dif- 
fers from that of the ""church of 
the Firstborn who have received 
the fulness of the Father, even 
as that of the '"rooon differs from 
the sun in the firmament. 

72. Behold, these are they who 
'"died without law; 

73. And also they who are 
the spirits of men "kept in 
prison, whom the Son visited, 
and preached the gospel unto 
them, that they might be judged 
according to men in the flesh; 

74. Who received not the tes- 
timony of Jesue in the flesh, but 
afterwards received it. 

75. These are they who are 
honorable men of the earth, who 



B blinded by the craftiness of 



77. These are they who receive 
of the presence of the Son, but 
not of the fulness of the Father. 

78. Wherefore, they are bodies 
terrestrial, and not bodies celes- 
tial, and difier in glory as the 
moon differs from the sun. 

79. These are they who are 
not valiant In the testimony of 
Jesus; wherefore, they obtain 
"not the crown over the kingdom 
of our God. 

80. And now this is the end of 
the vision which we saw of the 
terrestrial, that the Lord com- 
manded us to write while we 
were yet in the Spirit. 

81. And again, we saw the 
glory of the teleBtial, which glory 
is that of the lesser, even as the 
glory of the '"stars differs from 
that of the glory of the moon in 
the firmament. 

82. These are they who re- 
ceived not the gospel of Christ, 
neither the testimony of Jesus. 

83. These are they who deny 
not the Holy Spirit. 

84. These are they who are 
"thrust down to hell. 

S5. These are they who shall 
not be redeemed from the devil 
until the sr last resurrection, until 
the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, 
shall have finished his work. 

86. These are they who re- 
ceive not of his fulness in the 
eternal world, but of the Holy 
Spirit through the ministration 
of the terrestrial ;

the ministration of the celestial. 

88. And also the telestial re- 
ceive it of the 8d administering of 
angels who are appointed to min- 
ister for them, or who are ap- 
pointed to he ministering spirits 
for them ; for they 8e shall be heirs 
of salvation. 

89. And thus we saw, in the 
heavenly vision, the glory of the 
telestial, which surpasses all un- 
derstanding; 

90. And no man knows it ex- 
cept him to whom God has re- 
vealed it. 

91. And thus we saw the glory 
of the terrestrial which excels in 
all things the glory of the teles- 
tial, even in glory, and in power, 
and in might, and in dominion. 

92. And thus we saw the glory 
of the celestial, which excels in 
all things — where God, even the 
Father, reigns upon his throne 
forever and ever; 

93. Before whose throne all 
things bow in humble reverence, 
and give him glory forever and 
ever. 

94. They who dwell in 8 'his 
presence are the church of the 
Firstborn; and they see as they 
are seen, and know as they are 
known, having received of his 
fulness and of his grace; 

95. And he makes them 8 'equal 
in power, and in might, and in 
dominion. 

96. And the glory of the celes- 
tial is one, even as the glory of 
the 8h sun is one. 

97. And the glory of .the ter- 
restrial is one, even as the glory 
of the 81 moon is one. 

98. And the glory of the teles- 
tial is one, even as the glory of 



the stars is one; for as one 8 'star 
differs from another star in glory, 
even so differs one from another 
in glory in the telestial world; 

99. For these are they who are 
of Paul, and of Apo'llos, and of 
Cephas. 

100. These are they who say 
they are some of one and some 
of another — some of Christ and 
some of John, and some of Moses, 
and some of Elias, and some of 
Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and 
some of Enoch; 

101. But received not the gos- 
pel, neither the testimony of 
Jesus, neither the prophets, nei- 
ther the "everlasting covenant. 

102. Last of all, these all are 
they who will not be gathered 
with the saints, to be caught up 
unto 8, the church of the First- 
born, and received into the cloud. 

103. These are 8m they who are 
liars, and sorcerers, and adul- 
terers, and whoremongers, and 
whosoever loves and makes a lie. 

104. These are they who suffer 
the 8n wrath of God on earth.

106. These are they who are 
8p cast down to hell and suffer the

fulness of times, when Christ 
shall have subdued all enemies 
under his feet, and shall have 
perfected his work; 

107. When he shall 8 «deliver 
up the kingdom, and present it

den the wine-press alone, even 
the wine-press of the fierceness

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, 
March, 1832. An explanation of part of the Eevelation of John. 



1. Q. What is the sea of glass 
spoken of by John, 4th chapter, 
and 6th verse of the Revelation? 

A. It is the earth, in its sanc- 
tified, immortal, and eternal 
state. 

2. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the four beasts, spoken 
of in the same verse? 

A. They are figurative expres- 
sions, used by the Revelator, 
John, In describing heaven, the 



paradise of God, the happiness of 
man, and of beasts, and of creep- 
ing things, and of the fowls of 
the air; that which is spiritual 
being in the likeness of that 
which is temporal; and that 
which is temporal in the likeness 
of that which is spiritual; the 
spirit of man in the likeness of 
his person, as also the spirit of 
the beast, and every other crea- 
ture which God has created.

3. Q. Are the four beasts lim- 
ited to individual beasts, or do 
they represent classes or orders? 

A. They are limited to four 
individual beasts, which were 
shown to John, to represent the 
glory of the classes of beings in 
their destined order or sphere of 
creation, in the enjoyment of 
their eternal felicity. 

4. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the eyes and wings, 
which the beasts had? 

A. Their eyes are a represen- 
tation of light and knowledge, 
that is, they are full of knowl- 
edge; and their wings are a rep- 
resentation of power, to move, to 
act, etc. 

5. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the four and twenty 
elders, spoken of by John? 

A. We are to understand that 
these elders whom John saw, 
were elders who had been faith- 
ful in the work of the ministry 
and were dead; who belonged to 
the seven churches, and were 
then in the paradise of God. 

6. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the book which John 
saw, which was sealed on the 
back with seven seals? 

A. We are to understand that 
it contains the revealed will, mys- 
teries, and works of God; the 
hidden things of his economy con- 
cerning this earth during the 
seven thousand years of its con- 
tinuance, or its temporal exis- 
tence. 

7. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the seven seals with 
which it was sealed? 

A. We are to understand that 
the first seal contains the things 
of the first thousand years, and 
the second also of the second 
thousand years, and so on until 
the seventh. 

8. Q. What are we to under- 



stand by the four angels, spoken 
of in the 7th chapter and 1st 
verse of Revelation? 

A. We are to understand that 
they are four angels sent forth 
from God, to whom is given power 
over the four parts of the earth, 
to save life and to destroy; these 
are they who have the everlast- 
ing gospel to commit to every 
nation, kindred, tongue, and peo- 
ple; having power to shut up the 
heavens, to seal up unto life, or 
to cast down to the regions of 
darkness. 

9. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the angel ascending 
from the east, Revelation 7th 
chapter and 2nd verse? 

A. We are to understand that 
the angel ascending from the east 
is he to whom is given the seal 
of the living God over the twelve 
tribes of Israel; wherefore, he 
crieth unto the four angels hav- 
ing the everlasting gospel, say- 
ing: Hurt not the earth, neither 
the sea, nor the trees, till we have 
sealed the servants of our God 
in their foreheads. And, if you 
will receive it, this is Elias which 
was to come to gather together 
the tribes of Israel and restore 
all things. 

10. Q. What time are the 
things spoken of in this chapter 
to be accomplished? 

A. They are to be accom- 
plished in the sixth thousand 
years, or the opening of the sixth 
seal. 

11. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by sealing the one hundred 
and forty-four thousand, out of 
all the tribes of Israel — twelve 
thousand out of every tribe? 

A. We are to understand that 
those who are sealed are high 
priests, ordained unto the holy 
order of God, to administer the 
everlasting gospel; for they are

hey who are ordained out of 
&gt;very nation, kindred, tongue, 
ind people, by the angels to 
vhom is given power over the 
lations of the earth, to bring as 
n any as will come to the church 
&gt;f the Firstborn. 

12. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the sounding of the 
trumpets, mentioned in the 8th 
chapter of Revelation? 

A. We are to understand that 
is God made the world in six 
lays, and on the seventh day he 
finished his work, and sanctified 
It, and also formed man out of 
the dust of the earth, even so, in 
the beginning of the seventh 
thousand years will the Lord God 
sanctify the earth, and complete 
the salvation of man, and judge 
all things, and shall redeem all 
things, except that which he hath 
not put into his power, when he 
shall have sealed all things, unto 
the end of all things; and the 
sounding of the trumpets of the 
seven angels are the preparing 
and finishing of his work, in the 
beginning of the seventh thou- 
sand years — the preparing of the 



way before the time of his com- 
ing. 

13. Q. When are the things to 
be accomplished, which are writ- 
ten in the 9th chapter of Revela- 
tion? 

A. They are to be accomplished 
after the opening of the seventh 
seal, before the coming of Christ. 

14. Q. What are we to under- 
stand by the little book which 
was eaten by John, as mentioned 
in the 10th chapter of Revela- 
tion? 

A. We are to understand that 
it was a mission, and an ordi- 
nance, for him to gather the 
tribes of Israel; behold, this is 
Elias, who, as it is written, must 
come and restore all things. 

15. Q. What is to be under- 
stood by the two witnesses, in 
the eleventh chapter of Revela- 
tion? 

A. They are two prophets that 
are to be raised up to the Jewish 
nation in the last days, at the 
time of the restoration, and to 
prophesy to the Jews after they 
are gathered and have built the 
city of Jerusalem in the land of 
their fathers. 



SECTION 78. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, 
Ohio, March, 1832. The Order given of the Lord to Enoch [Joseph 
Smith, Jun.~\ for the purpose of establishing the poor. In the docu- 
mentary history of the Church, vol. 1, p. 255, appears this note: It 
was not always desirable that the individuals whom the Lord addressed 
in revelations should at the time be known by the world, and hence in 
this and in some subsequent revelations the brethren were addressed by 
other than their own names. The temporary necessity having passed 
for keeping the names of the individuals addressed unknown, their real 

names were subsequently given in brackets. A fuller organization 

of the people for the regulation of their temporal affairs necessary — 
Spirit of equality among the Saints inculcated — Additional revelation 
from time to time to be given — Membership in the Church of the 
Firstborn defined.

1. The Lord spake unto Enoch 
[Joseph Smith, Jun.], saying: 
Hearken unto me, saith the Lord 
your God, who are ordained 
unto the "high priesthood of my 
church, who have assembled 
yourselves together; 

2. And listen to the counsel of 
him who has ordained you from 
on high, who shall speak in your 
ears the words of wisdom, that 
salvation may be unto you in that 
thing which you have presented 
before me, saith the Lord God. 

3. For verily I say unto you, 
the time has come, and is now 
at hand; and behold, and lo, it 
must needs be that there be an 
'organization of my people, in 
regulating and establishing the 
affairs of the storehouse for the 
poor of my people, both in this 
place and in the land of Zion — 

4. Or in other words, the city 
of Enoch [Joseph], for a perma- 
nent and c everlasting establish- 
ment and order unto my church, 
to advance the cause, which ye 
have espoused, to the salvation of 
man, and to the glory of your 
Father who is in heaven; 

5. That you may be "equal in 
the bonds of heavenly things, 
yea, and earthly things also, for 
the obtaining of heavenly things. 

6. For if ye are not "equal in 
earthly things ye cannot be equal 
in obtaining heavenly things; 

7. For if you will that I give 
unto you a place in the celestial 
world, you must prepare your- 
selves by doing the things which 
I have commanded you and re- 
quired of you. 

8. And now, verily thus saith 
the Lord, it is expedient that all 
things be done unto my glory, by 



you who are joined together in 
this order; 

9. Or, in other words, let my 
servant Ahashdah [Newel K. 
Whitney] and my servant Gaze- 
lam, or Enoch [Joseph Smith, 
Jun.] and my servant Pelagoram 
[Sidney Rigdon], sit in council 
with the saints which are 'in 
Zion; 

10. Otherwise Satan seeketh 
to turn their hearts away from 
the truth, that they become blind- 
ed and understand not the things 
which are prepared for them. 

11. Wherefore, a command- 
ment I give unto you, to prepare 
and 'organize yourselves by a 
bond or everlasting covenant that 
cannot be broken. 

12. And he who breaketh it 
shall lose his office and standing 
in the church, and shall be de- 
livered over to the *buffetings of 
Satan until the day of redemp- 
tion. 

13. Behold, this is the prepara- 
tion wherewith I prepare you, 
and the foundation, and the en- 
sample which I give unto you, 
whereby you may accomplish the 
commandments which are given 
you; 

14. That through my provi- 
dence, notwithstanding the * tribu- 
lation which shall descend upon 
you, that the church may stand 
'independent above all other crea- 
tures beneath the celestial world; 

15. That you may come up 
unto the crown prepared for you, 
and be made rulers over *many 
kingdoms, saith the Lord God, 
the Holy One of Zion, who hath 
established the foundations of 
1 Adam-ondi-Ahman ;

high, and given unto him the keys 
of salvation "under the counsel 
and direction of the Holy One, 
who is without beginning of days 
or end of life. 

17. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, ye are little children, and 
ye have not as yet understood 
how great blessings the Father 
hath in his own hands and pre- 
pared for you; 

18. And ye cannot bear all 
things now; nevertheless, be of 
good cheer, for I will lead you 
along. The "kingdom is yours 
and the blessings thereof are 
yours, and the 'riches of eternity 
are yours. 



19. And he who receiveth all 
things with thankfulness shall be 
made glorious; and the things of 
this earth shall be added unto 
him, even an ^hundred fold, yea, 
more. 

20. Wherefore, do the things 
which I have commanded you, 
saith your Redeemer, even the 
Son r Ahman, who prepare th all 
things before he taketh you; 

21. For ye are the 'church of 
the Firstborn, and he will take 
you 'up in a cloud, and appoint 
every man his portion.

and "wise steward shall inherit 
all things. Amen.

the eastern countries, from place 
to place, and from city to city, in 
the power of the ordination 
wherewith he has been ordained,

For explanation of unusual names see heading to Section 78. The 

Lord reproves for sin and commends for repentance — Those who seek 
the mind of the Lord and then fait to abide by it are transgressors — 
The Lord is bound when his commandments are complied with — The 
Saints commanded to enter into covenant in the administration of their 
stewardships — Selfishness to be curbed and every man to seek the 
interest of his neighbor. 



1. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, my servants, that inasmuch 
as you have forgiven one another 
your trespasses, even so I, the 
Lord, forgive you. 

2 . Nevertheless, there are those 
among you who have sinned ex- 
ceedingly; yea, even all of you 
have sinned; but verily I say unto 
you, beware from henceforth, and 
refrain from sin, lest sore judg- 
ments fall upon your heads. 

3 . For of him unto whom "much 
is given much is required ; and he 
who sins against the greater light 
shall receive the greater condem- 
nation. 

4. Ye call upon my name for 
revelations, and I give them unto 
you; and inasmuch as ye keep 
not my sayings, which I give unto 
you, ye become transgressors; 
and justice and judgment are the 
penalty which is affixed unto my 
law. 

5. Therefore, what I say unto 
one I say unto all: Watch, for 
the adversary ft spreadeth his do- 
minions, and darkness reigneth; 

6. And the anger of God kin- 
dleth against the inhabitants of 
the earth; and none doeth good, 
for all have gone out of the way. 

7. And now, verily I say unto 
you, I, the Lord, will not lay any 
sin to your charge; go your ways 
and sin no more; but unto that 
soul who sinneth shall the for- 



mer sins return, saith the Lord 
your God. 

8. And again, I say unto you, 
I give unto you a new command- 
ment, that you may understand 
my will concerning you; 

9. Or, in other words, I give 
unto you directions how you may 
act before me, that it may turn 
to you for your salvation. 

10. I, the Lord, am bound 
when ye do what I say; but when 
ye do not what I say, ye have no 
promise. 

11. Therefore, verily I say 
unto you, that it is expedient for 
my servants Alam and Ahashdah 
[Newel K. Whitney], Mahalaleel 
and Pelagoram [Sidney Rigdon], 
and my servant Gazelam [Joseph 
Smith], and Horah and Olihah 
[Oliver Cowdery], and Shaleman-

a d bond and covenant that cannot 
be broken by transgression, ex- 
cept judgment shall immediately

12. To manage the affairs of 
the poor, and all things pertain- 
ing to the bishopric both in the 
land of Zion and in the land of 
Shinehah [Kirtland] ;

I say unto you, Zion must arise 
and put on her 'beautiful gar- 
ments. 

15. Therefore, I give unto you 
this commandment, that ye bind 
yourselves by this covenant, and 
it shall be done according to the 
laws of the Lord. 

16. Behold, here is wisdom also 
in me for your good. 

17. And you are to be 'equal, 
or in other words, you are to 
have equal claims on the proper- 
ties, for the benefit of managing 
the concerns of your steward- 
ships, every man according to his 
wants and his needs, inasmuch as 
his wants are just — 

18. And all this for the benefit 
of the "church of the living God, 
that every man may Mmprove 
upon his talent, that every man 
may gain other talents, yea, even 
an hundred fold, to be cast into 
the Lord's storehouse, to become 
the 'common property of the 
whole church —

terest of his neighbor, and doing 
all things with an eye single to 
the glory of God. 

20. This order I have appoint- 
ed to be an 'everlasting order 
unto you, and unto your succes- 
sors, inasmuch as you sin not. 

21. And the soul that sins 
against this covenant, and harden- 
eth his heart against it, shall be 
dealt with according to the laws 
of my church, and shall be de- 
livered over to the m buffetings of 
Satan until the day of redemp- 
tion. 

22. And now, verily I say unto 
you, and this is wisdom, make 
unto yourselves friends with the 
"mammon of unrighteousness, 
and they will not destroy you. 

23. Leave judgment alone with 
me, for it is mine and I will re- 
pay. Peace be with you; my

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, September 22 and 23, 1832. During the month of September, 
Elders had begun to return from their missions in the eastern States, 
and to make reports of their labors. It was while they were together 
in this season of joy that the following communication was received. 
The Prophet designates it a Revelation on Priesthood. See History 

of the Church, vol. 1, p. 286. A Temple to be built in the land 

of Zion during this generation — The line of the Holy Priesthood from 
Moses back to Adam — Relation between the Holy Priesthood and the 
Lesser Priesthood — Bearers of these two Priesthoods called the sons 
of Moses and of Aaron respectively — Blessings and privileges of those 
who attain to these Priesthoods — The bondage of sin — The new and 
everlasting covenant — Gifts of the spirit specified- — The Lord calls his 
servants,' friends — Missionary service imperative — Plagues impending 
because of wickedness. 

souri, and dedicated by the hand 
of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others 
with whom the Lord was well 
pleased. 

4. Verily this is the word of 
the Lord, that the city New Jeru- 
salem shall be built by the gather- 
ing of the saints, "beginning at 
this place, even the place of the 
temple, which temple shall be 
e reared in this generation. 

5. For verily this generation 
shall not 'all pass away until an 
house shall be built unto the 
Lord, and a 'cloud shall rest upon 
it, which cloud shall be even the 
glory of the Lord, which shall 
fill the house. 



1. A revelation of Jesus Christ 
unto his servant Joseph Smith, 
Jun., and six elders, as they 
united their hearts and lifted 
their voices on high. 

2. Yea, the word of the Lord 
concerning his church, estab- 
lished in the last days for the 
restoration of his people, as he 
has spoken by the mouth of his 
prophets, and for the "gathering 
of his saints to stand upon Mount 
Zion, which shall be the city of 
6 New Jerusalem. 

3. Which city shall be built, 
'beginning at the temple lot, 
which is appointed by the finger 
of the Lord, in the western 
boundaries of the State of Mis-

6. And the "sons of Moses, ac- 
cording to the Holy Priesthood 
which he received under the hand 
of his father-in-law, *Jethro; 

7. And Jethro received it un- 
der the hand of Caleb; 

8. And Caleb received it un- 
der the hand of Elihu; 

9. And Elihu under the hand 
of Jeremy; 

10. And Jeremy under the 
hand of Gad; 

11. And Gad under the hand 
of Esaias; 

12. And Esaias received it un- 
der the hand of God. 

13. Esaias also lived in the 
days of Abraham, and was blessed 
of him — 

14. Which Abraham received 
the 'priesthood from Melchize- 
dek, who received it through the 
lineage of his fathers, even till 
Noah; 

15. And from Noah till Enoch, 
through the *lineage of their fa- 
thers; 

16. And from Enoch 'to Abel, 
who was slain by the conspiracy 
of his brother, who received the 
•"priesthood by the command- 
ments of God, by the hand of 
his father Adam, who was the 
first man — 

17. Which "priesthood con- 
tinueth in the church of God in all 
generations, and is without be- 
ginning of days or end of years. 

18. And the Lord confirmed a 
priesthood also upon ° Aaron and 
his seed, throughout all their 
generations, which priesthood 
also continueth and p abideth for- 
ever with the priesthood which is 
«after the holiest order of God. 

19. And this 'greater priest- 



hood administereth the gospel 
and holdeth the key of the mys- 
teries of the kingdom, even the 
key of the knowledge of God. 

20. Therefore, in the ordi- 
nances thereof, the 'power of 
godliness is manifest. 

21. And without the ordi- 
nances thereof, and the authority 
of the priesthood, the power of 
godliness is 'not manifest unto 
men in the fiesh; 

22. For without this no man 
can "see the face of God, even the 
Father, and live. 

23. Now this Moses plainly 
taught to the children of Israel 
in the wilderness, and sought 
diligently to sanctify his people 
that they might v behold the face 
of God; 

24. But they hardened their 
hearts and could not endure his 
presence; therefore, the Lord in 
his wrath, for his anger was 
kindled against them, swore that 
they should not "enter into his 
rest while in the wilderness, 
which rest is the fulness of his 
glory. 

25. Therefore, he took Moses 
out of their midst, and the 'Holy 
Priesthood also; 

26. And the 'lesser priesthood 
continued, which priesthood hold- 
eth the *key of the ministering 
of angels and the preparatory 
gospel; 

27. Which gospel is the gospel 
of repentance and of baptism, and 
the remission of sins, and the law 
of carnal commandments, which 
the Lord In his wrath caused to 
continue with the ao house of 
Aaron among the children of 
Israel until John, whom God

raised up, being filled with the 
Holy Ghost from his mother's 
womb. 

28. Fpr he was baptized while 
he was yet in his childhood, and 
was ordained by the angel of God 
at the time he was eight days old 
unto this power, to overthrow the 
kingdom of the Jews, and to 
make "straight the way of the 
Lord before the face of his peo- 
ple, to prepare them for the com- 
ing of the Lord, in whose hand is 
given 2c all power. 

29. And again, the offices of 
elder and bishop are necessary 
2d appendages belonging unto the 
2 «high priesthood. 

30. And again, the offices of 
teacher and deacon are necessary 
2 'appendages belonging to the 
lesser priesthood, which priest- 
hood was confirmed upon Aaron 
and his sons. 

31. Therefore, as I said ^con- 
cerning the sons of Moses — for 
the sons of Moses and also the 
sons of Aaron shall offer an ac- 
ceptable offering and sacrifice in 
the house of the Lord, which 
house shall be built unto the Lord 
in "this generation, upon the 
"consecrated spot as I have ap- 
pointed — 

32. And the sons of Moses and 
of Aaron shall be 2 'filled with the 
glory of the Lord, upon Mount 
Zion in the Lord's house, whose 
sons are ye; and also many whom 
I have called and sent forth to 
build up my church. 

33. For whoso is faithful unto 
the obtaining these two priest- 
hoods of which I have spoken, 
and the magnifying their calling, 



are sanctified by the Spirit unto 
the "renewing of their bodies. 

34. They become the sons of 
Moses and of Aaron and the seed 
of Abraham, and the church and 
2, kingdom, and the 2m elect of 
God. 

35. And also all they who re- 
ceive this "priesthood receive 
me, saith the Lord; 

36. For he that receiveth my 
servants receiveth me; 

37. And he that receiveth me 
"receiveth my Father; 

38. And he that receiveth my 
Father 2p receiveth my Father's 
kingdom; therefore 2a all that my 
Father hath shall be given unto 
him. 

39. And this is according to 
the oath and covenant which be- 
lpngeth to the priesthood. 

40. Therefore, all those who 
receive the priesthood, receive 
this 2r oath and covenant of my 
Father, which he cannot break, 
neither can it be moved. 

41. But whoso breaketh this 
covenant after he hath received 
it, and altogether turneth there- 
from, shall "not have forgiveness 
of sins in this world nor in the 
world to come. 

42. And wo unto all those who 
come not unto this 2 'priesthood 
which ye have received, which I 
now confirm upon you who are 
present this day, by mine - own 
voice out of the heavens; and 
even I have given the "heavenly 
hosts and mine angels charge con- 
cerning you.

a commandment to beware con- 
cerning yourselves, to give dili-

gent heed to the words of eternal 
life. 

44. For you shall live by every 
word that proceedeth forth from 
the mouth of God. 

45. For the word of the Lord 
Is truth, and 2r whatsoever is truth 
Is light, and 2w whatsoever is light 
Is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus 
Christ. 

46. And the Spirit giveth 
light to 2 *every man that cometh 
into the world; and the Spirit 
enlighteneth every man 2,/ through 
the world, that hearkeneth to the 
voice of the Spirit. 

47. And every one that heark- 
eneth to the voice of the Spirit 
cometh unto God, even the Fa- 
ther. 

48. And the Father teacheth 
him of the 22 covenant which he 
has renewed and confirmed upon 
you, which is confirmed upon you 
for your sakes, and not for your 
sakes only, but for the sake of the 
whole world.. 

49. And the whole world lieth 
in sin, and groaneth under dark- 
ness and under the bondage of 
sin. 

50. And by this you may know 
they are under the bondage of 
sin, because they come not unto 
me. 

51. For whoso cometh not unto 
me is under the bondage of sin. 

52* And whoso receiveth not 
my voice is not acquainted with 
my voice, and is not of me. 

53. And by this you may know 
the righteous from the wicked, 
and that the whole world groan- 
eth under sin and darkness even 
now. 

54. And your minds in times 
past have been darkened because 



of unbelief, and because you have 
treated lightly the things you 
have received — 

55. Which vanity and unbelief 
have brought the 8o whole church 
under condemnation. 

56. And this condemnation 
resteth upon the children of Zion, 
even all. 

57. And they shall remain un- 
der this condemnation until they 
repent and remember the 86 new 
covenant, even the Book of Mor- 
mon and the former command- 
ments which I have given them, 
not only to say, but to do accord- 
ing to that which I have writ- 
ten — 

58. That they may bring forth 
fruit meet for their Father's king- 
dom; otherwise there remaineth 
a 3c scourge and judgment to be 
poured out upon the children of 
Zion. 

59. For shall the children of 
the kingdom pollute my holy 
land? Verily, I say unto you, 
Nay. 

60. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you who now hear my words, 
which are my voice, blessed are 
ye inasmuch as you receive these 
things; 

61. For I will forgive you of 
your sins with this command- 
ment — that you remain steadfast 
in your minds in "solemnity and 
the spirit of prayer, in bearing 
testimony to all the world of 
those things which are communi- 
cated unto you. 

62. Therefore, 86 go ye into all 
the world; and unto whatsoever 
place ye cannot go ye shall send, 
that the testimony may go from 
you into all the world unto every 
creature.

63. And as I said unto mine 
apostles, even so I say unto you, 
for you are 8 'mine apostles, even 
God's high priests; ye are they 
whom my Father hath given me; 
ye are my friends; 

64. Therefore, as I said unto 
mine apostles I say unto you 
again, that s 'every soul who be- 
lieveth on your words, and is bap- 
tized by water for the remission 
of sins, shall receive the Holy 
Ghost. 

65. And these "signs shall fol- 
low them that believe — 

66. In my name they shall do 
many wonderful works; 

67. In my name they shall cast 
out devils; 

68. In my name they shall heal 
the sick; 

69. In my name they shall 
open the eyes of the blind, and 
unstop the ears of the deaf; 

70. And the tongue of the 
dumb shall speak; 

71. And if any man shall ad- 
minister poison unto them it shall 
not hurt them; 

72. And the poison of a ser- 
pent shall not have power to harm 
them. 

73. But a commandment I give 
unto them, that they shall "not 
boast themselves of these things, 
neither speak them before the 
world; for these things are given 
unto you for your profit and for 
salvation. 

74. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, 8/ they who believe not on 
your words, and are not baptized 
in water in my name, for the re- 
mission of their sins, that they 
may receive the Holy Ghost, shall 
be damned, and shall not come 
into my Father's kingdom where 
my Father and I am. 



75. And this revelation unto 
you, and commandment, is in 
force s *from this very hour upon 
all the world, and the gospel is 
unto all who have not received it. 

76. But, verily I say unto all 
those to whom the 3 'kingdom has 
been given — from you it must be 
preached unto them, that they 
shall repent of their former evil 
works; for they are to be up- 
braided for their evil hearts of 
unbelief, and your brethren in 
Zion for their 8m rebellion against 
you at the time I sent you. 

77. And again I say unto you, 
my friends, for from henceforth 
I shall call you friends, it is ex- 
pedient that I give unto you this 
commandment, that ye become 
even as my friends in days when 
I was with them, traveling to 
preach the gospel in my power; 

78. For I suffered them not to 
have purse or scrip, neither two 
coats. 

79. Behold, I send you out to 
8n prove the world, and the laborer 
is worthy of his hire. 

80. And any man that shall 
go and preach this gospel of the 
kingdom, and fail not to continue 
faithful in all things, shall 3o not 
be weary in mind, neither dark- 
ened, neither in body, limb, nor 
joint; and a hair of his head shall 
not fall to the ground unnoticed. 
And they shall not go hungry, 
neither athirst. 

81. Therefore, 8p take ye no 
thought for the morrow, for what 
ye shall eat, or what ye shall 
drink, or wherewithal ye shall be 
clothed. 

82. For, consider the lilies of 
the field, how they grow, they 
toil not, neither do they spin ; and 
the kingdoms of the world, in all

The Lord hath gathered 4e all 

things in one. 
The Lord . hath brought down 

4 'Zion from above. 
The Lord hath brought up 4 'Zion 

from beneath. 

101. The earth hath travailed 
and brought forth her 
strength; 

And truth is established in her 

bowels; 
And the heavens have smiled 

upon her; 
And she is clothed 4 *with the 

glory of her God; 
For he stands in the midst of his 

people. 

102. Glory, and honor, and 
power, and might, 

Be ascribed to* our God; for he is 

full of mercy, 
Justice, grace and truth, and 

peace, 
Forever and ever, Amen. 

103. And again, verily, verily, 
I say unto you, it is expedient 
that every man who goes forth 
to proclaim mine everlasting gos- 
pel, that inasmuch as they have 
families, and receive money by 
gift, that they should send it unto 
them or make use of it for their 
benefit, as the Lord shall direct 
them, for thus it seemeth me 
good. 

104. And let all those who 
have not families, who receive 
money, send it up unto the bishop 
in Zion, or unto the bishop in 
Ohio, that it may be consecrated 
for the bringing forth of the 
revelations and the printing 
thereof, and for establishing Zion. 

105. And if any man shall give 
unto any of you a coat, or a suit, 
take the old and cast it unto the 
poor, and go on your way rejoic- 
ing. 

106. And -if any man among 



you be strong in the Spirit, let 
him take with him him that is 
weak, that he may be edified in 
all meekness, that he may be- 
come strong also. 

107. Therefore, take with you 
those who are ordained unto the 
4&lt; lesser priesthood, and send them 
before you to make appoint- 
ments, and to prepare the way, 
and to fill appointments that you 
yourselves are not able to fill. 

108. Behold, this is the way 
that mine apostles, in ancient 
days, built up my church unto 
me. 

109. Therefore, let every man 
stand in his own office, and labor 
in his own calling; and let not 
the head say unto the feet it 
hath 4 'no need of the feet; for 
without the feet how shall the 
body be able to stand? 

110. Also the body hath need 
of every member, that all may be 
edified together, that the system 
may be kept perfect. 

111. And behold, the "high 
priests should travel, and also the 
elders, and also the lesser priests; 
but the deacons and teachers 
should be appointed to watch over 
the church, to be standing minis- 
ters unto the church. 

112. And the bishop, Newel K. 
Whitney, also should travel round 
about and among all the churches, 
searching after the poor to ad- 
minister to their wants by hum- 
bling the rich and the proud.

with the sound of the gospel, with 
a loud voice, of the * 'desolation 
and utter abolishment which 
await them if they do reject these

forth as your circumstances shall 
permit, in your several callings,

in righteousness of all their ^un- 



righteous and ungodly deeds, set- 
ting forth clearly and under- 
standingly the '"desolation of 
abomination in the last days.

Lord Almighty, I will 4o rend their 
kingdoms; I will not only 4 'shake 
the earth, but the *«starry heav- 
ens shall tremble. 

119. For I, the Lord, have put 
forth my hand to * r exert the 
powers of heaven; ye cannot see 
it now, yet a little while and ye 
shall see it, and know that I am, 
and that I will **come and reign 
with my people. 

120. I am Alpha and Omega, 
the beginning and the end. 
Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, November 27, 1832, concerning the Saints in Zion, Missouri. 

See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 298. Inheritances in Zion 

to be received through consecration — Provision made for the assign- 
ment of inheritances among the Saints. 



1. It is the duty of the Lord's 
clerk, whom he has appointed, to 
keep a "history, and a general 
church record of all things that 
transpire in Zion, and of all those 
who consecrate properties, and 
receive inheritances legally from 
the bishop; 

2. And also their manner of 
life, their faith, and works; and 
also of the apostates who aposta- 
tize after receiving their inheri- 
tances. 

3. It is contrary to the will 
and commandment of God that 
those who receive not their in- 
heritance by ^consecration, agree- 
able to his law, which he has 



given, that he may tithe his peo- 
ple, to prepare them against the 
day of c vengeance and burning, 
should have their names enrolled 
with the people of God. 

4. Neither is their "genealogy 
to be kept, or to be had where 
it may be found on any of the 
records or history of the church. 

5. Their names shall not be 
found, neither the names of the 
fathers, nor the names of the 
children written in the e book of 
the law of God, saith the Lord of 
Hosts.

and often times it maketh my 
bones to quake while it maketh 
manifest, saying: 

7. And it shall come to pass 
that I, the Lord God, will send 
one mighty and strong, holding 
the scepter of power in his hand, 
clothed with light for a covering, 
whose mouth shall utter words, 
eternal words; while his bowels 
shall be a fountain of truth, to 
Bet In order the house of God, 
and to arrange by *lot the inheri- 
tances of the saints whose names 
are found, and the names of their 
fathers, and of their children, en- 
rolled in the 'book of the law of 
God; 

8. While that man, who was 
called of God and appointed, that 
putteth forth his hand to 'steady 
the ark of God, shall fall by the 
shaft of death, like as a tree that 
is smitten by the vivid shaft of 
lightning. 

9. And all they who are not 



found written in the 'book of 
remembrance shall find none in- 
heritance in that day, but they 
shall be cut asunder, and their 
portion shall be appointed them 
among unbelievers, where are 
m wailing and gnashing of teeth. 

10. These things I say not of 
myself; therefore, as the Lord 
speaketh, he will also fulfil. 

11. And they who are of the 
"High Priesthood, whose names 
are not found written in the book 
of the law, or that are found to 
have apostatized, or to have been 
cut off from the church, as well 
as the lesser priesthood, or the 
members, in that day shall °not 
find an inheritance among the 
saints of the Most High; 

12. Therefore, it shall be done 
unto them as unto the children 
of the priest, as will be found 
recorded in the second chapter 
and sixty-first and second verses 
of Ezra.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, December 6, 1832. Exposition of the "Lord's parable con- 
cerning the wheat and the tares — Its application to the latter days. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you my servants, concern- 
ing the parable of the wheat and 
of the tares: 

2. Behold, verily I say, the 
field was the world, and the apos- 
tles were the sowers of the seed; 

3. And after they have fallen 
asleep, the "great persecutor of 
the church, the apostate, the 
whore, even *Babylon, that mak- 
eth all nations to drink of her 
cup, in whose hearts the enemy, 
even Satan, sitteth to reign — be- 
hold he soweth the tares; where- 



fore, the tares choke the wheat 
and c drive the church into the 
wilderness. 

4. But behold, in the last days, 
even now while the Lord is be- 
ginning to bring forth the word,- 
and the blade is springing up 
and is yet tender — 

5. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, the angels are 'crying unto 
the Lord day ana" night, who are 
ready and waiting to be sent 
forth to reap down the fields; 

6. But the Lord saith unto 
them, pluck not up the tares

while the blade is yet tender (for 
verily your faith is weak), lest 
you destroy the wheat also. 

7. Therefore, let the wheat 
and the tares grow together until 
the harvest is fully ripe; then ye 
shall first gather out the wheat 
from among the tares, and after 
the gathering of the wheat, be- 
hold and lo, the tares are bound 
in bundles, and the field remain- 
eth to be burned. 

8. Therefore, thus saith the 
Lord unto you, with whom 
the priesthood hath continued 
through the 'lineage of your fa- 
thers — 



9. For ye are lawful heirs, ac- 
cording to the flesh, and have 
been hid from the world 'with 
Christ in God — 

10. Therefore your life and the 
priesthood have remained, and 
must needs remain through yon 
and your lineage 'until the resto- 
ration of all things spoken by 
the mouths of all the holy proph- 
ets since the world began. 

11. Therefore, blessed are ye 
if ye continue in my goodness, a 
light unto the Gentiles, and 
through this priesthood, a *savior 
unto my people Israel. The Lord 
hath said it. Amen.

Revelation and Prophecy on War, given through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, December 25, 1832. Wars predicted — Division be- 
tween the Northern States and the Southern States — Great calamities 
in manifestation of the chastening hand of God. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
concerning the wars that will 
shortly come to pass, beginning 
at the rebellion of South Caro- 
lina, which will eventually ter- 
minate in the death and misery 
of many souls; 

2. And the time will come that 
war will be poured out upon all 
nations, "beginning at this place. 

3. For behold, the Southern 
States shall be divided against 
the Northern States, and the 
Southern States will call on other 
nations, even the nation of Great 
Britain, as it is called, and they 
shall also call upon other nations, 
in order to defend themselves 
against other nations; and then 
"war shall be poured out upon all 
nations. 



4. And it shall come to pass, 
after many days, c slaves shall 
rise up against their masters, 
who shall be marshaled and dis- 
ciplined for war. 

5. And it shall come to pass 
also that the d remnants who are 
left of the land will marshal 
themselves, and shall become ex- 
ceedingly angry, and shall vex 
the Gentiles with a sore vexation. 

6. And thus, with the sword 
and by bloodshed the inhabitants 
of the earth shall mourn; and 
with famine, and plague, and 
earthquake, and the thunder of 
heaven, and the fierce and vivid 
lightning also, shall the inhabi- 
tants of the earth be made to feel

Kevelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, December 27, 1832. Designated by the Prophet, the Olive Leaf. 

mSee History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 302. Ministrations of the 

Comforter — The light of truth is the light of Christ — The spirit 
*xnd the body constitute the soul — Parable of the man sending his ser- 
vants into the field and visiting them in turn — Search for the truth 
through study and prayer enjoined — Testimony of the Elders to be 
jfollowed by that of calamity — Scenes incident to the Lord's coming — 
^The angels sounding their trumpets in turn as appointed — Duties of 
~the Presidency of the School of the Prophets — The ordinance of wash- 
ing of feet. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you who have assembled 
"yourselves together to receive his 
'will concerning you: 

2. Behold, this is pleasing unto 
your Lord, and the angels re- 
joice over you; the alms of your 
prayers have come up into the 
ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and 
are recorded in the book of the 
names of the sanctified, even 
them of the celestial world. 

3. Wherefore, I now send upon 
you another "Comforter, even 
upon you my friends, that it may 
abide in your hearts, even the 
Holy Spirit of promise; which 
other Comforter is the same that 
I promised unto my disciples, as 
is recorded in the testimony of 
John. 

4. This Comforter is the prom- 
ise which I give unto you of eter- 



nal life, even the glory of the 
celestial kingdom; 

5. Which glory is that of the 
6 church of the Firstborn, even of 
God, the holiest of all, through 
Jesus Christ his Son — 

6. He that ascended up on 
high, as also he descended be- 
low all things, in that he com- 
prehended all things, that he 
might be in all and through all 
things, d the light of truth; 

7. Which truth shineth. This 
is the light of Christ. As also 
he is e in the sun, and the light 
of the sun, and the power thereof 
by which it was made.

stars, and the power thereof by 
which they were made; 

10. And the earth also, and the 
power thereof, even the earth 
upon which you stand. 

11. And the light which shin- 
eth, which giveth you light, is 
through him who enlighteneth 
your eyes, which is the *same 
light that quickeneth your un- 
derstandings; 

12. Which light proceedeth 
forth from the presence of God 
to fill the immensity of space — 

13. The light which is in all 
things, which giveth 'life to all 
things, which is the *law by 
which all things are governed, 
even the power of God who sit- 
teth upon his throne, who is in 
the bosom of eternity, who is in 
the midst of all things. 

14. Now, verily I say unto you, 
that through the redemption 
which is made for you is brought 
to pass the 'resurrection from the 
dead. 

15. And the spirit and the body 
are the soul of man. 

16. And the resurrection from 
the dead is the redemption of the 
soul. 

17. And the redemption of the 
soul is through him that quick- 
eneth all things, in whose bosom 
it is decreed that the poor and 
the meek of the earth m shall in- 
herit it. 

18. Therefore, it must needs 
be sanctified from all unright- 
eousness, that it may be prepared 
for the celestial glory; 

19. For after it hath filled the 
measure of its creation, it shall 
be crowned with glory, even with 
the "presence of God the Father; 

20. That bodies who are of the 
celestial kingdom may "possess it 



forever and ever; for, for this la- 
tent was it made and created, 
and for this intent are they sanc- 
tified. 

21. And they who are not sanc- 
tified through the law which I 
have given unto you, even the law 
of Christ, must inherit "another 
kingdom, even that of a terres- 
trial kingdom, or that of a teles- 
tial kingdom. 

22. For he who is not able to 
abide the law of a 'celestial king- 
dom cannot abide a celestial 
glory. 

23. And he who cannot abide 
the law of a terrestrial kingdom 
cannot abide a terrestrial glory. 

24. And he who cannot abide 
the law of a 'telestial kingdom 
cannot abide a telestial glory; 
therefore he is not meet for a 
kingdom of glory. Therefore he 
must abide a kingdom which is 
not a kingdom of glory. 

25. And again, verily I say 
unto you, the earth abideth the 
law of a celestial kingdom, for it 
filleth the measure of its creation, 
and transgresseth not the law— 

26. Wherefore, it shall be sanc- 
tified; yea, notwithstanding 'it 
shall die, it shall be quickened 
again, and shall abide the power 
by which it is quickened, and 
"the righteous shall inherit it. 

27. For notwithstanding they 
die, they also shall rise again, a 
"spiritual body. 

28. They who are of a celes- 
tial spirit shall receive the same 
body which was a natural body; 
even ye shall receive your bodies, 
and your glory shall be that 
glory by which your bodies are 
quickened.

a portion of the celestial glory

shall then receive of the same, 
even a fulness. 

30. And they who are 'quick- 
ened by a portion of the terres- 
trial glory shall then receive of 
the same, even a fulness. 

31. And also they who are 
'quickened by a portion of the 
telestial glory shall then receive 
of the same, even a fulness. 

32. And they who remain shall 
also be quickened; nevertheless, 
they shall return again to their 
own place, to enjoy that which 
they are willing to receive, be- 
cause they were not willing to 
enjoy that which they might 
have received. 

33. For what doth it profit a 
man if a gift is bestowed upon 
him, and he receive not the gift? 
Behold, he rejoices not in that 
which is given unto him, neither 
rejoices in him who is the giver 
of the gift. 

34. And again, verily I say 
unto you, that which is governed 
by law is also preserved by law 
and 'perfected and sanctified by 
the same. 

35. That which breaketh a 
law, and abideth not by law, but 
seeketh to become a law unto it- 
self, and willeth to abide in sin, 
and altogether abideth in sin, 
cannot.be sanctified by law, nei- 
ther by mercy, justice, nor judg- 
ment. Therefore, they must ^re- 
main filthy still. 

36. All "kingdoms have a law 
given; 

37. And there are many king- 
doms; for there is 2c no space in 
the which there is no kingdom; 
and there is no kingdom in which 
there is no space, either a greater 
or a lesser kingdom. 

38. And unto "every kingdom 



is given a law; and unto every 
law there are certain bounds 
also and conditions. 

39. All beings who abide not 
in those conditions are not jus- 
tified. 

40. For intelligence cleaveth 
unto intelligence; wisdom re- 
ceiveth wisdom; truth embraceth 
truth; virtue loveth virtue; light 
cleaveth unto light; mercy hath 
compassion on mercy and claim- 
eth her own; justice continueth 
its course and claimeth its own; 
judgment goeth before the face 
of him who sitteth upon the 
throne and governeth and execut- 
eth all things. 

41. He 2e comprehendeth all 
things, and all things are before 
him, and all things are round 
about him; and he is above all 
things, and in all things, and is 
through all things, and is round 
about all things; and all things 
are by him, and of him, even God, 
forever and ever. 

42. And again, verily I say 
unto you, he hath given a 2 'law 
unto all things, by which they 
move in their times and their 
seasons; 

43. And their courses are 
fixed, even the courses of the 
heavens and the earth, which 
comprehend the earth and all the 
planets. 

44. And they give light to each 
other in their times and in their 
seasons, in their minutes, in their 
hours, in their days, in their 
weeks, in their months, in their 
years — all these are 2 'one year 
with God, but not with man.

wings, and the sun giveth his 
light by day, and the moon giveth 
her light by night, and the stars

also give their light, as they roll 
upon their wings in their glory, 
in the midst of the power of 
God. 

46. Unto what shall I liken 
these kingdoms, that ye may un- 
derstand? 

47. Behold, all these are king- 
doms, and any man who hath 
seen any or the least of these 
hath seen God moving in his ma- 
jesty and power. 

48. I say unto you, he hath 
seen him; nevertheless, he who 
came unto his own was not com- 
prehended. 

49. The light "shineth in dark- 
ness, and the darkness compre- 
hendeth it not; nevertheless, the 
day shall come when 21 you shall 
comprehend even God, being 
quickened in him and by him. 

50. Then shall ye know that ye 
2 'have seen me, that I am, and 
that I am the true light that is 
in you, and that you are in me; 
otherwise ye could not abound. 

51. Behold, I will liken these 
kingdoms unto a man having a 
field, and he sent forth his ser- 
vants into the field to dig in the 
field. 

52. And he said unto the first: 
Go ye and labor in the field, and 
in the first hour I will come unto 
you, and ye shall behold the joy 
of my countenance. 

53. And he said unto the sec- 
ond: Go ye also into the field, 
and in the second hour I will visit 
you with the joy of my counte- 
nance. 

54. And also unto the third, 
saying: I will visit you; 

55. And unto the fourth, and 
so on unto the twelfth. 

56. And the lord of the field 
went unto the first in the first 
hour, and tarried with him all 



that hour, and he was made glad 
with the light of the countenance 
of his lord. 

57. And then he withdrew 
from the first that he might visit 
the second also, and the third, 
and the fourth, and so on unto 
the twelfth. 

58. And thus they all received 
the light of the countenance of 
their lord, every man in his hour, 
and in his time, and in his sea- 
son — 

59. Beginning at the first, and 
so on unto the last, and from the 
last unto the first, and from the 
first unto the last; 

60. Every man in his own or- 
der, until his hour was finished, 
even according as his lord had 
commanded him, that his lord 
might be glorified in him, and he 
in his lord, that they all might 
be glorified. 

61. Therefore, unto this para- 
ble I will liken all these king- 
doms, and the inhabitants there- 
of—every kingdom in its hour, 
and in its time, and in its sea- 
son, even according to the decree 
which God hath made. 

62. And again, verily I say 
unto you, my friends, I leave 
these sayings with you to ponder 
in your hearts, with this com- 
mandment which I give unto you, 
that ye shall call upon me while 
I am near — 

63. Draw near unto me and I 
will draw near unto you; seek 
me diligently and ye shall find 
me; 2m ask, and ye shall receive; 
knock, and it shall be opened 
unto you. 

64. Whatsoever ye ask the Fa- 
ther in my name it shall be given 
unto you, that is expedient for 
you; 

6 5 . And if ye ask anything that

is not expedient for you, it shall 
turn unto your condemnation. 

66. Behold, that which you 
hear is as the 2n voice of one cry- 
ing in the wilderness — in the 
wilderness, because you cannot 
see him — my voice, because my 
voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; 
truth abideth and hath no end; 
and if it be in you it shall abound. 

67. And if your eye be single 
to my glory, your whole bodies 
shall be filled with light, and 
there shall be no 2o darkness in 
you ; and that body which is filled 
with light comprehendeth all 
things. 

68. Therefore, sanctify your- 
selves that your minds become 
single to God, and the days will 
come that you shall 2p see him; 
for he will unveil his face unto 
you, and it shall be in his own 
time, and in his own way, and 
according to his own will. 

69. Remember the great and 
last promise which I have made 
unto you; cast away your idle 
thoughts and your 2 «excess of 
laughter far from you. 

70. Tarry ye, tarry ye in this 
place, and call a 2r solemn assem- 
bly, even of those who are the 
first laborers in this last king- 
dom. 

71. And let those whom they 
have warned in their traveling 
call on the Lord, and ponder the 
warning in their hearts which 
they have received, for a little 
season. 

72. Behold, and lo, I will take 
2are of your fiocks, and will raise 
dp elders and send unto them. 

73. Behold, I will hasten my 
work in its time. 



74. And I give unto you, who 
are the first laborers in this last 
kingdom, a commandment that 
you assemble yourselves together, 
and organize yourselves, and pre- 
pare yourselves, and sanctify 
yourselves; yea, purify your 
hearts, and *'cleanse your hands 
and your feet before me, that I 
may make you clean; 

75. That I may testify unto 
your Father, and your God, and 
my God, that you are clean from 
the blood of this wicked genera- 
tion; that I may fulfil this prom- 
ise, this great and last promise, 
which I have made unto you, 
when I will. 

76. Also, I give unto you a 
commandment that ye shall con- 
tinue in 2 'prayer and fasting from 
this time forth. 

77. And I give unto you a com- 
mandment that you shall teach 
one another the doctrine of the 
kingdom. 

78. Teach ye diligently and 
my grace shall attend you, that 
you may be instructed more per- 
fectly in theory, in principle, in 
doctrine, in the law of the gos- 
pel, in 2tt all things that pertain 
unto the kingdom of God, that 
are expedient for you to under- 
stand; 

79. Of things both in heaven 
and in the earth, and under the 
earth; things which have been, 
things which are, things which 
must shortly come to pass; things 
which are at home, things which 
are abroad ; the wars and the per- 
plexities of the nations, and the 
judgments which are on the land; 
and a knowledge also of countries 
and of kingdoms —

80. That ye may be prepared 
in all things when I shall send 
you again to magnify the calling 
whereunto I have called you, and 
the mission with which I have 
commissioned you. 

81. Behold, I sent you out to 
testify and warn the people, and 
it becometh every man who hath 
been warned to warn his neigh- 
bor. 

82. Therefore, they are left 
without excuse, and their sins are 
upon their own heads. 

83. He that seeketh me early 
shall find me, and shall not be 
forsaken. 

84. Therefore, tarry ye, and 
labor diligently, that you may be 
perfected in your ministry to go 
forth among the Gentiles for the 
last time, as many as the mouth 
of the Lord shall name, to 2c bind 
up the law and seal up the testi- 
mony, and to prepare the saints 
for the hour of judgment which 
is to come; 

85. That their souls may es- 
cape the wrath of God, the 2w deso- 
lation of abomination which 
awaits the wicked, both in this 
world and in the world to come. 
Verily, I say unto you, let those 
who are not the first elders con- 
tinue in the vineyard until the 
mouth of the Lord shall call 
them, for their time is not yet 
come; their garments are not 
clean from the blood of this gen- 
eration. 

86. Abide ye in the liberty 
wherewith ye are made free; en- 
tangle not yourselves in sin, but 
let your hands be clean, until the 
Lord comes. 

87. For not many days hence 
and the earth shall tremble and 
2 *reel to and fro as a drunken 



man; and the sun shall **hide bis 
face, and shall refuse to give 
light; and the moon shall be 
bathed in blood; and the stars 
shall become exceedingly angry, 
and shall cast themselves down 
as a fig that falleth from off a 
fig-tree. 

88. And after your testimony 
cometh wrath and indignation 
upon the people. 

89. For after your testimony 
cometh the 2 *testimony of earth- 
quakes, that shall cause groan- 
in gs in the midst of her, and men 
shall fall upon the ground and 
shall not be able to stand. 

90. And also cometh the testi- 
mony of the voice of thunder- 
ings, and the voice of lightnings, 
and the voice of tempests, and 
the voice of the waves of the sea 
heaving themselves beyond their 
bounds. 

91. And all things shall be in 
commotion; and surely, men's 
hearts shall fail them; for fear 
shall come upon all people. 

92. And angels shall fly 
through the midst of heaven, cry- 
ing with a So loud voice, sounding 
the trump of God, saying: Pre- 
pare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants 
of the earth; for the judgment of 
our God is come. Behold, and lo, 
the Bridegroom cometh; go ye 
out to meet him. 

93. And immediately there 
shall appear a s "great sign in 
heaven, and all people shall see 
it together. 

94. And another angel shall 
sound his trump, saying: That 
3c great church, the mother of 
abominations, that made all* na- 
tions drink of the wine of the 
wrath of her fornication, that 
persecuteth the saints of God,

that shed their blood — she who 
sitteth upon many* waters, and 
upon the islands of the sea — be- 
hold, she is the tares of the earth; 
she is bound in bundles; her 
bands are made strong, no man 
can loose them; therefore, she is 
ready to be burned. And he shall 
sound his trump both long and 
Loud, and all nations shall hear it. 

95. And there shall be sd silence 
In heaven for the space of half 
an hour; and immediately after 
shall the curtain of heaven be 
unfolded, as a scroll is unfolded 
after it is rolled up, and the S6 face 
of the Lord shall be unveiled; 

96. And the s 'saints that are 
upon the earth, who are alive, 
shall be quickened and be caught 
up to meet him. 

97. And they who have 8 'slept 
In their graves shall come forth, 
tor their graves shall be opened; 
and they also shall be caught up 
to meet him in the midst of the 
pillar of heaven — 

98. They are Christ's, the first 
fruits, they who shall descend 
with him first, and they who are 
on the earth and in their graves, 
who are first caught up to meet 
him; and all this by the voice of 
the sounding of the trump of the 
ingel of God. 

99. And after this another an- 
jel shall sound, which is the sec- 
ond trump; and then cometh the 
redemption of those who are 
Christ's at his coming; who have 
received their 8 *part in that prison 
which is prepared for them, that 
:hey might receive the gospel, and 
be judged according to men in the 
flesh. 

100. And again, another trump 
shall sound, which is the third 
trump; and then come the "spir- 



its of men who are to be judged, 
and are found under condemna- 
tion; 

101. And these are the rest of 
the dead; and they live not again 
until the thousand years are 
ended, neither again, until the 
end of the earth. 

102. And another trump shall 
sound, which is the fourth trump, 
saying: There are found among 
those who are to remain until 
that great and last day, even the 
end, who shall remain ai filthy 
still. 

103. And another trump shall 
sound, which is the fifth trump, 
which is the fifth angel who com- 
mitteth the everlasting gospel — 
flying through the midst of heav- 
en, unto all nations, kindreds, 
tongues, and people; 

104. And this shall be the 
sound of his trump, saying to all 
people, both in heaven and in 
earth, and that are under the 
earth — for every ear shall hear 
it, and s *every knee shall bow, 
and every tongue shall confess, 
while they hear the sound of the 
trump, saying: Fear God, and 
give glory to him who sitteth 
upon the throne, forever and 
ever; for the hour of his judg- 
ment is come. 

105. And again, another angel 
shall sound his trump, which is 
the sixth angel, saying: s, She is 
fallen who made all nations drink 
of the wine of the wrath of 
her fornication; she is fallen, is 
fallen ! 

106. And again, another angel 
shall sound his trump, which is 
the seventh angel, saying: It is 
finished; it is finished! The Lamb 
of God hath overcome and 8m trod- 
den the wine-press alone, even

the wine-press of the fierceness of 
the wrath of Almighty God. 

107. And then shall the angels 
be crowned with the glory of his 
might, and the saints shall be 
filled with his glory, and **re- 
ceive their inheritance and be 
made 8o equal with him. 

108. And then shall the first 
angel again sound his trump in 
the ears of all living, and reveal 
the secret acts of men, and the 
mighty works of God in the first 
thousand years. 

109. And then shall the second 
angel sound his trump, and re- 
veal the secret acts of men, and 
the thoughts and intents of their 
hearts, and the mighty works of 
God in the second thousand 
years — 

110. And so on, until the 
seventh angel shall sound his 
trump; and he shall stand forth 
upon the land and upon the sea, 
and swear in the name of him 
who sitteth upon the throne, that 
there shall be time no longer; 
and Satan shall be 8p bound, that 
old serpent, who is called the 
devil, and shall not be loosed for 
the space of a thousand years. 

111. And then he shall be 
loosed for a little season, that he 
may gather together his armies. 

112. And 8 «Michael, the seventh 
angel, even the archangel, shall 
gather together his armies, even 
the hosts of heaven. 

113. And the devil shall gather 
together his armies; even the 
hosts of hell, and shall come up 
to battle against Michael and his 
armies. 

114. And then cometh the bat- 
tle of the great God; and the 
devil and his armies shall be cast 
away into their own place, that 



they shall not have power over 
the saints any more at all. 

115. For Michael shall fight 
their battles, and shall overcome 
him who seeketh the throne of 
him who sitteth upon the throne, 
even the Lamb. 

116. This is the glory of God, 
and the sanctified; and they shall 
not any more see death. 

117. Therefore, verily I say 
unto you, my friends, call your 
solemn assembly, as I have com- 
manded you. 

118. And as all have not faith, 
seek ye diligently and teach one 
another words of wisdom; yea, 
seek ye out of the * r best books 
words of wisdom; seek learning, 
even by study and also by faith. 

119. Organize yourselves; pre- 
pare every needful thing; and 
''establish a house, even a house 
of prayer, a house of fasting, a 
house of faith, a house of learn- 
ing, a house of glory* a house of 
order, a house of God; 

120. That your incomings may 
be in the name of the Lord; that 
your outgoings may be in the 
name of the Lord; that all your 
salutations may be in the name 
of the Lord, with uplifted hands 
unto the Most High. 

121. Therefore, cease from all 
your light speeches, from all 
8 'laughter, from all your lustful 
desires, from all your pride and 
light-mindedness, and from all 
your wicked doings. 

122. Appoint among yourselves 
a teacher, and let not all be 
spokesmen at once; but let one 
speak at a time and let all listen 
unto his sayings, that when all 
have spoken that all may be edi- 
fied of all, and that every man 
may have an equal privilege.

other; cease to be covetous; learn 

tp Impart one to another as the 
gospel requires. 

124. Cease to be Idle; cease to 
he unclean; cease to find fault 
one with another; cease to sleep 
longer than Is needful; retire to 
thy bed early, that ye may not 
be weary; arise early, that your 
bodies and your minds may be 
Invigorated. 

125. And above all things, 
clothe yourselves with the bond 
of charity, as with a mantle, 
which is the bond of perfectness 
and peace. 

12S. Pray always, that ye may 
not faint, until I come. Behold, 
and lo, I will "come quickly, and 
receive you unto myself. Amen. 

127. And again, the order of 
the house prepared for the presi- 
dency of the "school of the proph- 
ets, established for their in- 
struction in all things that are 
expedient for them, even for all 
the officers of the church, or in 
other words, those who are called 
to the ministry in the church, 
beginning at the high priests, 
sven down to the deacons — 

128. And this shall be the or- 
3er of the house of the presidency 
3f the school: He that is ap- 
pointed to be president, or teach- 
er, shall be found standing in his 
place, in the house which shall be 
prepared for him. 

129. Therefore, he shall be first 
In the house of God, In a place 
that the congregation in the 
house may hear his words care- 
fully and distinctly, not with loud 
speech. 

130. And when he cometh 
Into the house of God, for he 
should be first in the house — be- 
hold, this Is beautiful, that he 






mple- 



131. Let him offer himself in 
prayer upon his knees before 
God, in token or remembrance of 
the ""everlasting covenant. 

132. And when any shall come 
in after him, let the teacher 
arise, and, with uplifted hands to 
heaven, yea, even directly, salute 
his brother or brethren with 
these words: 

133. Art thou a brother or 
brethren? I salute you in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
in token or remembrance of the 
'•everlasting covenant, in which 
covenant 1 receive you to fellow- 
ship, In a determination that la 
fixed, immovable, and unchange- 
able, to be your friend and brother 
through the grace of God in the 
bonds of love, to walk in all the 
commandments of God blameless, 
in thanksgiving, forever and ever. 

134. And he that is found un- 
worthy of this salutation shall 
not have place among you; for 
ye shall not suffer that mine 
house shall be polluted by him. 

135. And he that cometh in 
and is faithful before me, and is 
a brother, or if they be brethren, 
they shall salute the president or 
teacher with uplifted hands to 
heaven, with this same prayer 
and covenant, or by saying Amen, 
in token of the same. 

136. Behold, verily, I say unto 
you, this is an ensample unto 
you for a salutation to one an- 
other in the house of God, in the 
"'school of the prophets. 

137. And ye are called to do 
this by prayer and thanksgiving, 
as the Spirit shall give utterance 
in all your doings In the house of 
the Lord, in the school of the 
prophets, that It may become a

sanctuary, a tabernacle of the 
Holy Spirit to your edification. 

138. And ye shall not receive 
any among you into this school 
save he is clean from the blood 
of this generation; 

139. And he shall be received 
by the ordinance of the "washing 
of feet, for unto this end was the 
ordinance of the washing of feet 
instituted. 



140. And again/ the ordinance 
of washing feet is to be adminis- 
tered by the president, or presid- 
ing elder of the church. 

141. It is to be commenced 
with prayer; and after partaking 
of bread and wine, he is to gird 
himself according to the pattern 
given in the thirteenth chapter 
of John's testimony concerning 
me. Amen. 



SECTION 89. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, February 27, 1833, known as the Word of Wisdom. Absti- 
nence from wine, strong drink, tobacco and hot drinks enjoined — 
Moderation in the eating of meat — Wholesome foods — Promises to 
those who live according to these precepts. 



1. A Word of Wisdom, for the 
benefit of the council of high 
priests, assembled in Kirtland, 
and the church, and also the 
saints in Zion — 

2. To be sent greeting; not by 
commandment or constraint, but 
by revelation and the word of 
wisdom, showing forth the order 
and will of God in the temporal 
salvation of all saints in the last 
days — 

3. Given for a principle with 
•promise, adapted to the capacity 
of the weak and the weakest of 
all saints, who are or can be 
called saints. 

4. Behold, verily, thus saith the 
Lord unto you: In consequence 
of evils and designs which do 
and will exist in the hearts of 
conspiring men in the last days, 
I have warned you, and forewarn 
you, by giving unto you this word 
of wisdom by revelation — 

5. That inasmuch as any man 
drinketh wine or strong drink 
among you, behold it is not good, 



neither meet in the sight of your 
Father, only in assembling your- 
selves together to offer up your 
sacraments before him. 

6. And, behold, this should be 
wine, yea, 6 pure wine of the grape 
of the vine, of your own make. 

7. And, again, c strong drinks 
are not for the belly, but for the 
washing of your bodies. 

8. And again, tobacco is not 
for the body, neither for the belly, 
and is not good for man, but is an 
herb for bruises and all sick cat- 
tle, to be used with judgment 
and skill. 

9. And again, hot drinks are 
not for the body or belly. 

10. And again, verily I say 
unto you, d all wholesome herbs 
God hath ordained for the con- 
stitution, nature, and use of 
man — 

11. Every herb in the season 
thereof, and every fruit in the 
season thereof; all these to be 
used with prudence and thanks- 
giving.

155 



12. Yea, flesh also of beasts 
and of the fowls of the air, I, the 
Lord, have ordained for the use 
of man with thanksgiving; never- 
theless they are to be used spar- 
ingly; 

13. And it is pleasing unto me 
that they should not be used, 
•only in times of winter, or of 
cold, or famine. 

14. All grain is ordained for 
the use of man and of beasts, to 
be the staff of life, not only for 
man but for the beasts of the 
field, and the fowls of heaven, 
and all wild animals that run or 
creep on the earth; 

15. And these hath God made 
for the use of man only in 'times 
of famine and excess of hunger. 

16. All grain is good for the 
food of man; as also the fruit of 
the vine; that which yieldeth 
fruit, whether in the ground or 
above the ground — 



17. Nevertheless, wheat for 
man, and corn for the ox, and 
oats for the horse, and rye for 
the fowls and for swine, and for 
all beasts of the field, and bar- 
ley for all useful animals, and 
for mild drinks, as also other 
grain. 

18. And all saints who remem- 
ber to keep and do these sayings, 
walking in obedience to the com- 
mandments, shall "receive health 
in their navel and marrow to 
their bones; 

19. And shall *find wisdom 
and great treasures of knowledge, 
even hidden treasures; 

20. And shall run and not be 
weary, and shall walk and not 
faint. 

21. And I, the Lord, give unto 
them a promise, that the destroy- 
ing angel 'shall pass by them, as 
the children of Israel, and not 
slay them. Amen. 



SECTION 90. 

Revelation to Joseph Smith the Prophet, given at Kirtland, Ohio, 
March 8, 1833, Position of Joseph as President of the Church re- 
affirmed. Accountability of those who receive the oracles of God — 

The Gospel to be preached throughout the world — Worthy servants 
commended and offenders reproved. 



1. Thus saith the Lord, verily, 
verily I say unto you my son, thy 
sins are forgiven thee, according 
to thy petition, for thy prayers 
and the prayers of thy brethren 
have come up into my ears. 

2. Therefore, thou art blessed 
from henceforth that bear the 
keys of the kingdom given unto 
you; which "kingdom is coming 
forth for the last time. 

3. Verily I say unto you, the 
keys of this kingdom shall never 
be taken from you, while thou 



art in the world, neither in the 
world to come; 

4. Nevertheless, through you 
shall the oracles be given to 
another, yea, 6 even unto the 
church. 

5. And all they who receive 
the oracles of God, let them be- 
ware how they hold them lest 
they are accounted as a light 
thing, and are brought under con- 
demnation thereby, and stumble

6. And again, verily I say unto 
thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and 
Frederick G. Williams, their sins 
are forgiven them also, and they 
are accounted as equal with thee 
in holding the keys of this last 
kingdom ; 

7. As also through your ad- 
ministration the keys of the 
c school of the prophets, which I 
have commanded to be organ- 
ized; 

8. That thereby they may be 
perfected in their ministry for 
the salvation of Zion, and of the 
nations of Israel, and of the Gen- 
tiles, as many as will believe; 

9. That through your adminis- 
tration they may receive the 
word, and through their admin- 
istration the word may go forth 
unto the ends of the earth, d unto 
the Gentiles first, and then, be- 
hold, and lo, e they shall turn unto 
the Jews. 

10. And then cometh the day 
when the arm of the Lord shall 
be 'revealed in power in con- 
vincing the nations, the heathen 
nations, the house of Joseph, of 
the gospel of their salvation. 

11. For it shall come to pass 
in that day, that every man shall 
hear the fulness of the gospel in 
his own tongue, and in his own 
language, through those who are 
ordained unto this power, by the 
administration of the "Comforter, 
shed forth upon them for the 
revelation of Jesus Christ. 

12. And now, verily I say unto 
you, I give unto you a command- 
ment that you continue in the 
ministry and presidency. 

13. And when you have fin- 
ished the translation of the proph- 
ets, you shall from thenceforth 



preside over the affairs of the 
church and the school; 

14. And from time to time, as 
shall be manifested by the Com- 
forter, receive revelations to un- 
fold the mysteries of the king- 
dom; 

15. And set in order the 
churches, and study and learn, 
and become acquainted with *all 
good books, and with languages, 
tongues, and people. 

16. And this shall be yonr 
business and mission in all your 
lives, to preside in council, and 
set in order all the affairs of this 
church and kingdom. 

17. Be not ashamed, neither 
confounded; but be admonished 
in all your high-mindedness and 
pride, for it bringeth a snare upon 
your souls. 

18. Set in order your houses; 
keep f slothfulness and 'un clean- 
ness far from you. 

19. Now, verily I say unto you, 
let there be a place provided, as 
soon as it is possible, for the fam- 
ily of thy counselor and scribe, 
even Frederick G. Williams. 

20. And let mine aged servant, 
Joseph Smith, Sen., continue with 
his family upon the place where 
he now lives; and let it not be 
sold until the mouth of the Lord 
shall name. 

21. And let my counselor, even 
Sidney Rigdon, remain where he 
now resides until the mouth of 
the Lord shall name. 

22. And let the bishop search 
diligently to obtain an agent, and 
let him be a man who has got 
riches in store — a man of God, 
and of strong faith — 

23. That thereby he may be 
enabled to discharge every debt; 
that the storehouse of the Lord 
may not be brought into disre-

pate before the eyes of the peo- 
ple. 

24. Search diligently, pray al- 
ways, and be believing, and all 
things shall work together for 
your good, if ye walk uprightly 
and remember the covenant 
wherewith ye have covenanted 
one with another. 

25. Let your families be small, 
especially mine aged servant 
Joseph Smith's, Sen., as pertain- 
ing to those who do not belong 
to your families; 

26. That those things that are 
provided for you, to bring to pass 
my work, be not taken from you 
and given to those that are not 
worthy — 

27. And thereby you be hin- 
dered in accomplishing those 
things which I have commanded 
you. 

28. And again, verily I say 
unto you, it is my will that my 
handmaid Vienna Jaques should 
receive money to bear her ex- 
penses, and go up unto the land 
of Zion; 

29. And the residue of the 
money may be consecrated unto 
me, and she be rewarded in mine 
own due time. 

30. Verily I say unto you, that 
it is meet in mine eyes that she 
should go up unto the land of 



Zion, and receive an inheritance 
from the hand of the bishop; 

31. That she may settle down 
in peace inasmuch as she is faith- 
ful, and not be idle in her days 
from thenceforth. 

32. And behold, verily I say 
unto you, that ye shall write this 
commandment, and say unto your 
brethren in Zion, in love greet- 
ing, that I have called you also 
to preside over Zion in mine own 
due time. 

33. Therefore, let them cease 
wearying me concerning this mat- 
ter. 

34. Behold, I say unto you 
that your brethren in Zion begin 
to repent, and the angels rejoice 
over them. 

35. Nevertheless, I am not well 
pleased with many things; and I 
am not well pleased with my ser- 
vant William E. M'Lellin, neither 
with my servant Sidney Gilbert; 
and the bishop also, and others 
have many things to repent of. 

36. But verily I say unto you, 
that I, the Lord, will contend with 
Zion, and plead with her strong 
ones, and k chasten her until she 
overcomes and is clean before 
me. 

37. For she shall not be re- 
moved out of her place. I, the 
Lord, have spoken it. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, March 9, 1833. The Prophet was at this time engaged in the 
study of the ancient writings regarded by some as Scripture and known 

distinctively as the Apocrypha. These writings not to be accepted 

as Scripture — Enlightenment of the Spirit requisite to discernment of 
the truth contained in these books. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you concerning the Apocry- 
pha — There are many things con- 



tained therein that are true, and 

it is mostly translated correctly; 

2. There are many things con-

tained therein that are not true, 
which are interpolations by the 
hands of men. 

3. Verily, I say unto you, that 
it is not needful that the Apoc- 
rypha should be translated. 

4. Therefore, whoso readeth 
it, let him understand, for the 
Spirit manifesteth truth; 



5. And whoso is enlightened 
by the Spirit shall obtain benefit 
therefrom; 

6. And whoso receiveth not by 
the Spirit, cannot be benefited. 
Therefore it is not needful that 
it should be translated. Amen.

land, Ohio } March 15, 1833. For explanation of unusual names see 

heading to Section 78. Commandment regarding admission to the 

United Order. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, 
I give unto the "united order, or- 
ganized agreeable to the com- 
mandment previously given, a 
revelation and commandment 
concerning my servant Sheder- 
laomach [Frederick G. Williams], 
that ye shall receive him into the

say unto all. 



2. And again, I say unto yon 
my servant Shederlaomach [Fred- 
erick G. Williams], you shall be 
a lively member in this order; 
and inasmuch as you are faith- 
ful in keeping all former com- 
mandments you shall be blessed 
forever. Amen. 



SECTION 93. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 

Ohio, May 6, 1833. The Lord defines the relation between himself 

and the Father — The record of John, the Apostle and Revelator— 
Jesus Christ the Firstborn — Man was in the beginning with God — The 
elements are eternal — The glory of God is intelligence — Man innocent 
in the beginning — Erring ones, even though in high authority in the 
Church, reproved. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord: 
It shall come to pass that every 
soul who forsaketh his sins and 
cometh unto me, and calleth on 
my name, and obeyeth my voice, 
and keepeth my commandments, 
shall "see my face and know that 
I am; 



2. And that I am the true light 
that "lighteth every man that 
cometh into the world; 

3. And that I am c in the Fa- 
ther, and the Father d in me, and 
the Father and I are one —

me of his fulness, and the Son

because I was in the world and 
made flesh my tabernacle, and 
. dwelt among the sons of men. 

5. I was in the world and re- 
ceived of my Father, and the 
•works of him were plainly mani- 
fest. 

6. And John saw and bore 
record of the fulness of my glory, 
and the fulness of John's record 
is hereafter to be revealed. 

7. And he bore record, saying: 
I saw his glory, that he r was in 
the beginning, before the world 
was; 

8. Therefore, in the beginning 
the Word was, for he was the 
Word, even the messenger of sal- 
vation — 

9. The light and the Redeemer 
of the world; the Spirit of truth, 
who came into the world, because 
the world was made by him, and 
In him was the life of men and 
the light of men. 

10. The worlds were made by 
him; men were made by him; all 

- things were made by him, and 
through him, and of him. 

11. And I, John, bear record 
that I beheld his glory, as the 
glory of the Only Begotten of the 
Father, full of grace and truth, 
even the Spirit of truth, which 
came and dwelt in the flesh, and 
dwelt among us. 

12. And I, John, saw that he 
received not of the "fulness at 
the first, but received grace for 

■; grace; 

t 13. And he received not of the 

^ fulness at first, but continued 

r&gt; from grace to grace, until he re- 

^ ceived a fulness; 

-. 14. And thus he was called the 

• *~ Son of God, because he received 

- *» not of the fulness at the first. 



15. And I, John, bear record, 
and lo, the heavens were opened, 
and the Holy Ghost descended 
upon him in the form of a dove, 
and sat upon him, and there came 
a voice out of heaven saying: 
This is my beloved Son. 

16. And I, John, bear record 
that he received a fulness of the 
glory of the Father; 

17. And he received *all power, 
both in heaven and on earth, and 
the glory of the Father was with 
him, for he dwelt in him. 

18. And it shall come to pass, 
that if you are faithful you shall 
receive the fulness of the record 
of John. 

19. I give unto you these say- 
ings that you may understand 
and know how to worship, and 
know what you worship, that you 
may come unto the Father in my 
name, and in due time receive of 
his fulness. 

20. For if you keep my com- 
mandments you shall receive of 
his 'fulness, and be glorified in 
me as I am in the Father; there- 
fore, I say unto you, you shall 
receive grace for grace. 

21. And now, verily I say unto 
you, I was in the beginning with 
the Father, and am the 'First- 
born; 

22. And all those who are be- 
gotten through me are partakers 
of the glory of the same, and are 
the *church of the Firstborn. 

23. Ye were also in the begin- 
ning with the Father; that wh.ich 
is 'Spirit, even the Spirit of truth; 

24. And truth is knowledge of 
things as they are, and as they 
were, and as they are to come; 

25. And whatsoever is more or 
less than this is the spirit of that

wicked one who was a liar from 
the beginning. 

26. The Spirit of truth is of 
God. I m am the Spirit of truth, 
and John bore record of me, say- 
ing: He received a fulness of 
truth, yea, even of all truth; 

27. And no man receiveth a 
fulness unless he keepeth his 
commandments. 

28. He that keepeth his com- 
mandments receiveth truth and 
light, until he is glorified in truth 
and "knoweth all things. 

29. Man was also in the •be- 
ginning with God. Intelligence, 
or the light of truth, was not cre- 
ated or made, neither indeed can 
be. 

30. All truth is independent in 
that sphere in which God has 
placed it, to act for itself, as all 
intelligence also; otherwise there 
is no existence. 

31. Behold, here is the agency 
of man, and here is the condem- 
nation of man; because that 
which was from the beginning is 
plainly manifest unto them, and 
they receive not the light. 

32. And every man whose spirit 
receiveth not the light is under 
condemnation. 

33. For "man is spirit. The 
elements are 'eternal, and spirit 
and element, inseparably con- 
nected, receive a fulness of joy; 

34. And when separated, man 
cannot receive a fulness of joy. 

35. The elements are the ''tab- 
ernacle of God; yea, man is the 
tabernacle of God, 'even tem- 
ples; and whatsoever temple is 
defiled, God shall destroy that 
temple. 

36. The glory of God is intelli- 



gence, or, in other words, light 
and truth. 

37. Light and truth forsake, 
that evil one. 

38. Every spirit of man was 
'innocent in the beginning; and 
God having redeemed man from 
the fall, men became again, in 
their "infant state, innocent be- 
fore God. 

39. And that wicked one Com- 
eth and taketh away light and 
truth, through disobedience, from 
the children of men, and because 
of the tradition of their fathers. 

40. But I have commanded yon 
to bring up your children in light 
and truth. 

41. But verily I say unto you, 
my servant Frederick G. Wil- 
liams, you have continued under 
this condemnation; 

42. You have not taught your 
children light and truth, accord- 
ing to the commandments; and 
that wicked one hath power, as 
yet, over you, and this is the 
cause of your affliction. 

43. And now a commandment 
I give unto you — if you will be 
delivered you shall set in order 
your own house, for there are 
many things that are not right 
in your house. 

44. Verily, I say unto my ser- 
vant Sidney Rigdon, that In some 
things he hath not kept the com- 
mandments ooncernlng his chil- 
dren ; therefore, first set in order 
thy house. 

45. Verily, I say unto my ser- 
vant Joseph Smith, Jun., or in 
other words, I will call you 
friends, for you are my friends, 
and ye shall have an inheritance 
with me —

servants for my sake — 

471 And now, verily I say unto 
Joseph Smith, Jun. — You have 
lot kept the commandments, and 
must needs stand rebuked before 
the Lord; 

48. Your family must needs 
repent and forsake some things,

tet in order his family, and see 
hat they are more diligent and

51. Now, I say unto you, iny 
friends, let my servant Sidney 
Rigdon go on his journey, and 
make haste, and also proclaim , 
the acceptable year of the Lord, 
and the gospel of salvation, as I 
shall give him utterance; and by 
your prayer of faith with one con- 
sent I will uphold him.

Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. 
Williams make haste also, and It 
shall be given them even accord- 
ing to the prayer of faith; and 
inasmuch as you keep my say- 
ings you shall not be confounded 
in this world, nor in the world 
to come. 

53. And, verily I say unto you, 
that it is my will that you should 
hasten to "translate my scrip- 
tures, and to obtain a knowledge 
of history, and of countries, and 
of kingdoms, of laws of God and 
man, and all this for the salva-

I love I also chasten that their 
sins may be forgiven, for with the 
chastisement I prepare a way for

2. Wherefore, ye must needs 



be chastened and stand rebuked 
before my face;

me a very grievous sin, in that 
ye have not considered the great 
commandment in all things, that

with I design to prepare mine

flesh — 

5. But behold, verily I say 
unto you, that there are many 
who have been ordained among 
you, whom I have called but e few 
of them are chosen. 

6. They who are not chosen 
have sinned a very grievous sin, 
in that they are walking in dark-

unto you a commandment that 
you should call your 'solemn as-

that you should build a house, in 
the which house I design to "en- 
dow those whom I have chosen 
with power from on high; 

9. For this is the ^promise of 
the Father unto you; therefore 
I command you to tarry, even as 
mine apostles at Jerusalem. 

10. Nevertheless, my servants 
sinned a very grievous sin; and 
contentions arose in the *school 
of the prophets; which was very 
grievous unto me, saith your 
Lord ; therefore I sent them forth 
to be chastened. 



11. Verily I say unto you, it is 
my will that you should build a 
house. If you keep my com- 
mandments you shall have power 
to build it. 

12. If you keep not my com- 
mandments, the love of the Fa- 
ther shall not continue with you, 
therefore you shall walk in dark- 
ness. 

13. Now here is wisdom, and 
the mind of the Lord — let the 
house be built, not after the man- 
ner of the world, for I give not 
unto you that ye shall live after 
the manner of the world; 

14. Therefore, let it be built 
after the manner which I shall 
show unto 'three of you, whom 
ye shall appoint and ordain unto 
this power. 

15. And the size thereof shall 
be fifty and five feet in width, and 
let it be sixty-five feet in length, 
in the inner court thereof. 

16. And let the lower part of 
the inner court be dedicated unto 
me for your sacrament offering, 
and for your preaching, and your 
fasting, and your praying, and 
the offering up of your most 
holy desires unto me, saith your 
Lord. 

17. And let the higher part of 
the inner court be dedicated unto 
me for the *school of mine apos- 
tles, saith Son Ahman; or, in 
other words, Alphus; or, in other 
words, Omegus ; even Jesus Christ 
your Lord. Amen.

the Lord if the people are faithful, otherwise many calamities to fall 
upon them. 



1. Verily I say unto you my 
friends, I speak unto you with my 
voice, even the voice of my Spirit, 
that I may show unto you my will 
concerning your brethren in the 
land of Zion, many of whom are 
truly humble and are seeking dili- 
gently to learn wisdom and to 
find truth. 

2. Verily, verily I say unto you, 
blessed are such, for they shall 
obtain; for I, the Lord, show 
mercy unto all the meek, and 
upon all whomsoever I will, that 
I may be justified when I shall 
bring them unto judgment. 

3. Behold, I say unto you, con- 
cerning the °school in Zion, I, 
the Lord, am well pleased that 
there should be a school in Zion, 
and also with my servant Parley 
P. Pratt, for he abideth in me. 

4. And inasmuch as he con- 
tinueth to abide in me he shall 
continue to preside over the 
school in the land of Zion until 
I shall give unto him other com- 
mandments. 

5. And I will bless him with a 
multiplicity of blessings, in ex- 
pounding all scriptures and mys- 
teries to the edification of the 
school, and of the church in Zion. 

6. And to the residue of the 
school, I, the Lord, am willing to 
show mercy; nevertheless, there 
are those that must needs be 
chastened, and their works shall 
be made known. 

7. The 6 ax is laid at the root 
of the trees; and every tree that 
bringeth not forth good fruit 
shall be hewn down and cast into 
the fire. I, the Lord, have spoken 
it. 

8. Verily I say unto you, all 



among them who know their 
hearts are honest, and are broken, 
and their spirits contrite, and are 
willing to observe their covenants 
by sacrifice — yea, every sacrifice 
which I, the Lord, shall command 
— they are accepted of me. 

9. For I, the Lord, will cause 
them to bring forth as a very 
fruitful tree which is planted in 
a goodly land, by a pure stream, 
that yieldeth much precious fruit. 

10. Verily I say unto you, that 
it is my will that a c house should 
be built unto me in the land of 
Zion, like unto the pattern which 
I have given you. 

11. Yea, let it be built speed- 
ily, by the d tithing of my people. 

12. Behold, this is the tithing 
and the sacrifice which I, the 
Lord, require at their hands, that 
there may be a house built unto 
me for the salvation of Zion — 

13. For a place of thanksgiv- 
ing for all saints, and for a place 
of instruction for all those who 
are called to the work of the 
ministry in all their several call- 
ings and offices; 

14. That they may be perfected 
in the understanding of their min- 
istry, in theory, in principle, and 
in doctrine, in all things pertain- 
ing to the kingdom of God on the 
earth, the keys of which kingdom 
have been conferred upon you. 

15. And inasmuch as my peo- 
ple build a house unto me in the 
name of the Lord, and do not 
suffer any unclean thing to come 
into it, that it be not defiled, e my 
glory shall rest upon it; 

16. Yea, and r my presence

into it, and all the pure in heart

God. 

17. But if it be defiled I will 
not come into it, and my glory 
shall not be there; for I will not 
come into unholy temples. 

18. And, now, behold, if Zion 
do these things she shall prosper, 
and spread herself and become 
very glorious, very great, and 
very terrible. 

19. And the nations of the 
earth shall honor her, and shall 
say: Surely Zion is the city of 
our God, and surely Zion cannot 
fall, neither be moved out of her 
place, for God is there, and the 
hand of the Lord is there; 

20. And he hath sworn by the 
power of his might to be her sal- 
vation and her high tower. 

21. Therefore, verily, thus 
saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, 
for this is Zion — *the pure in 
heabt; therefore, let Zion rejoice, 
while all the wicked shall mourn. 

22. For behold, and lo, *ven- 
geance cometh speedily upon the 
ungodly as the whirlwind; and 
who shall escape it? 

23. The Lord's 'scourge shall 



pass over by night and by day, 
and the report thereof shall vex 
all people; yea, it shall not be 
stayed until the Lord come; 

24. For the indignation of the 
Lord is kindled against their 
abominations and all their wicked 
works. 

25. Nevertheless, Zion shall 
escape if she observe to do all 
things whatsoever I have com- 
manded her. 

26. But if she observe not to 
do whatsoever I have commanded 
her, I will visit her According to 
all her works, with sore affliction, 
with pestilence, with plague, with 
sword, with vengeance, with de- ' 
vouring fire. 

27. Nevertheless, let it be read 
this once to her ears, that I, the 
Lord, have accepted of her offer- 
ing; and if she sin no more none 
of these things shall come upon 
her; 

28. And I will bless her with 
blessings, and multiply a mul- 
tiplicity of blessings upon her, 
and upon her generations forever 
and ever, saith the Lord your 
God. Amen.

promise unto you, with an im- 
mutable covenant that they shall 
be fulfilled; and all things where- 
with you have been afflicted shall 
work together for your good, and 
to my name's glory, saith the 
Lord. 

4. And now, verily I say unto 
you concerning the laws of the 
land, it is my will that my peo- 
ple should observe to do all 
things whatsoever I .command 
them. 

5. And that law of the land 
which is constitutional, support- 
ing that principle of freedom in 
maintaining rights and privileges, 
belongs to all mankind, and is 
justifiable before me. 

6. Therefore, I, the Lord, 
justify you, and your brethren 
of my church, in befriending that 
law which is the Constitutional 
law of the land; 

7. And as pertaining to law 
of man, whatsoever is more or 
less than this cometh of evil.

free, therefore ye are free in-

you free.

1 . Wherefore, honest men and 
wise men should be sought for 
diligently, and good men and 
wise men ye should observe to 
uphold; otherwise whatsoever is 
less than these cometh of evil. 

11. And I give unto you a com- 
mandment, that ye shall forsake 
all evil and cleave unto all good, 
that ye shall live by every word 
which proceed eth forth out of the 
mouth of God. 

12. For he will give unto the 
faithful line upon line, precept 



upon precept; and I will try you 
and prove you herewith. 

13. And whoso c layeth down 
his life in my cause, for my 
name's sake, shall find it again, 
even life eternal. 

14. Therefore, be not afraid 
of your enemies, for I have de- 
creed in my heart, saith the Lord, 
that I will prove you in all things, 
whether you will abide in my 
covenant, d even unto death, that 

,you may be found worthy. 

15. For if ye will not abide 
in my covenant ye are not worthy 
of me. 

16. Therefore, renounce war 
and proclaim peace, and seek dili- 
gently to turn the e hearts of the 
children to their fathers, and the 
hearts of the fathers to the chil^ 
dren;

the Jews unto the prophets, and 
the prophets unto the Jews; lest 
I come and smite the whole earth 
with a curse, and all flesh be con- 
sumed before me. 

18. Let not your hearts be 
troubled; for in my Father's 
house are "many mansions, and 
I have prepared a place for you; 
and where my Father and I am, 
there ye shall be also.

their sins, and their wicked ways, 
the pride of their hearts, and 
their covetousness, and all their 
detestable things, and observe

life which I have given unto

they do not repent and observe 
all things whatsoever I have said 
unto them. 

22. And again I say unto you, 
if ye observe to do whatsoever I 
command you, I, the Lord, will 
turn away all wrath and indigna- 
tion from you, and the *gates of 
hell shall not prevail against you. 

23. Now, I speak unto you con- 
cerning your families — if men 
will smite you, or your families, 
once, and ye bear it patiently and. 
revile not against them, neither 
seek revenge, ye shall be re- 
warded ; 

24. But if ye bear it not pa- 
tiently, it shall be accounted unto 
you as being meted out as a just 
measure unto you. 

25. And again, if your enemy 
shall smite you the second time, 
and you revile not against your 
enemy, and bear it patiently, 
your reward shall be an hundred- 
fold. 

26. And again, if he shall smite 
you the third time, and ye bear 
it patiently, your reward shall be 
doubled unto you four-fold; 

27. And these three testi- 
monies shall stand against your 
enemy if he repent not, and shall 
not be blotted out. 

28. And now, verily I say unto 
you, if that enemy shall escape 
my vengeance, that he be not 
brought into judgment before me, 
then ye shall see to it that ye 
warn him in my name, that he 
come no more upon you, neither 
upon your family, even your chil- 
dren's children unto the third 
and fourth generation. 

29. And then, if he shall come 
upon you or your children, or 
your children's children unto the 
third and fourth generation, I 
have delivered thine enemy into 
thine hands; 



30. And then if thou wilt spare 
him, thou shalt be rewarded for 
thy righteousness; and also thy 
children and thy children's chil- 
dren unto the third and fourth 
generation. 

31. Nevertheless, thine enemy 
is in thine hands; and if thou re- 
wardest him according to his 
works thou art justified; if he 
has sought thy life, and thy life 
is endangered by him, thine en- 
emy is in thine hands and thou 
art justified. 

32. Behold, this is the law I 
gave unto my servant Nephi, and 
thy fathers, Joseph, and Jacob, 
and Isaac, and Abraham, and all 
mine ancient prophets and apos- 
tles. 

33. And again, this is the *law 
that I gave unto mine ancients, 
that they should not go out unto 
battle against any nation, kin- 
dred, tongue, or people, save I, 
the Lord, commanded them. 

34. And if any nation, tongue, 
or people should proclaim war 
against them, they should first 
lift a 'standard of peace unto that 
people, nation, or tongue; 

35. And if that people did not 
accept the offering of peace, nei- 
ther the second nor the third 
time, they should bring these tes- 
timonies before the Lord; 

36. Then I, the Lord, would 
give unto them a commandment, 
and justify them in going out to 
battle against that nation, tongue, 
or people. 

37. And I, the Lord, would 
fight their battles, and their chil- 
dren's battles, and their children's 
children's, until they had avenged 
"themselves on all their enemies, 

to the third and fourth genera- 
tion.

your God, for Justification before 
me. 

39. And again, verily I say 
unto you, if after thine enemy 
has come- upon thee the first time, 
he repent and come unto thee 
praying thy forgiveness, thou 
shalt forgive him, and shalt hold 
it no more as a testimony against 
thine enemy — 

40. And so on unto the second 
and third time; and as oft as 
thine enemy repenteth of the tres- 
pass wherewith he has trespassed 
against thee, thou shalt forgive 
him, until seventy times seven. 

41. And if he trespass against 
thee and repent not the first time, 
nevertheless thou shalt forgive 
him. 

42. And if he trespass against 
thee the second time, and repent 
not, nevertheless thou shalt for- 
give him. 

43. And if he trespass against 
thee the third time, and repent 
not, thou shalt also forgive him. 

44. But if he trespass against 
thee the fourth time thou shalt 
not forgive him, but shalt bring 
these testimonies before the 



Lord; and they shall not be blot- 
ted out until he repent and re- 
ward thee four-fold in all things 
wherewith he has trespassed 
against thee. 

45. And if he do this, thou 
shalt forgive him with all thine 
heart; and if he do not this, I, 
the Lord, will *avenge thee of 
thine enemy an hundred-fold; 

46. And upon his children, and 
utfon his children's children of 
all them that hate me, unto the 
'third and fourth generation. 

47. But if the "Children shall 
repent, or the children's children, 
and turn to the Lord their God, 
with all their hearts and with all 
their might, mind, and strength, 
and restore four-fold for all their 
trespasses wherewith they have 
trespassed, or wherewith their 
fathers have trespassed, or their 
father's fathers, then thine in- 
dignation shall be turned away; 

48. And vengeance shall no 
more come upon them, saith the 
Lord thy God, and their tres- 
passes shall never be brought any 
more as a testimony before the 
Lord against them. Amen.

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Sidney Bigdon,

forting assurances as to their families — Many of the Lord's people in 
that region — Sidney Bigdon to be a spokesman unto the Prophet and 
to be mighty in expounding the Scriptures — Assurances concerning 
affairs in Zion. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, my friends Sidney and 
Joseph, your families are well; 
they are in mine hands, and I 
will do with them as seemeth me 
good; for in me there is all power.

round about; and an effectual 
door shall be opened in the re-

place; for thus it was expedient

this the Holy Ghost shall be shed

things whatsoever ye shall say. 

9. And it is expedient in me

you unto this calling, even to be

the things of my kingdom on the 
earth. 

12. Therefore, continue your 
journey and let your hearts re- 
joice; for behold, and lo, I am 
with you even unto the end. 

13. And now I give unto you a 
word concerning Zion. Zion shall 
be "redeemed, although she is 
chastened for a little season. 

14. Thy brethren, my servants 
Orson Hyde and John Gould, are 



in my hands; and inasmuch as 
they keep my commandments 
they shall be saved. 

15. Therefore, let your hearts 
be comforted; for all things shall 
"work together for good to them 
that walk uprightly, and to the 
sanctification of the church. 

16. For I will raise up unto 
myself a pure people, that will 
serve me in righteousness; 

17. And all that call upon the 
name of the Lord, and keep his 
commandments, shall be saved. 
Even so. Amen. 



SECTION 101. 

Revei*ation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, December 16, 1833, At this time the Saints who had gathered 
in Missouri were suffering great persecution. Mobs had driven them 
from their homes in Jackson County, and some of the Saints had tried 
to establish themselves in Van Buren County, but persecution followed 
them. The main body of the Church was at that time in Clay County, 
Missouri. Threats of death against individuals of the Church were 
many. The people had lost household furniture, clothing, livestock 
and other personal property, and many of their crops had been de- 
stroyed. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 456. Affliction per- 
mitted to befall the Saints because of their transgression — The Lord's 
indignation to be poured out upon all nations — The pure in heart 
among those who had been expelled from Zion to return — Other stakes 
of Zion to be established — Blessed state incident to the millennial era 
of peace — Parable of the nobleman and the olive-trees — Gathering of 
the Saints to be continued — Those who have been oppressed by their 
enemies to importune for redress — Creation of the Constitution of the 
United States directed by the Lord — Parable of the woman and the 
unjust judge. 



1. Verily I say unto you, con- 
cerning your brethren who have 
been afflicted, and persecuted, 
and °cast out from the land of 
their ' inheritance — 

2. I, the Lord, have suffered 



the affliction to come upon them, 
wherewith they have been afflict- 
ed, in consequence of "their trans- 
gressions; 

3. Yet I will own them, and 
they shall be mine in that day

when I shall come to make up 
'my jewels. 

4. Therefore, they must needs 
be chastened and tried, even as 
Abraham, who was commanded 
to offer up his only son. 

5. For all those who will not 
endure chastening, but deny me, 
cannot be sanctified. 

6. Behold, I say unto you, 
there were jarrings, and conten- 
tions, and envyings, and strifes, 
and lustful and covetous desires 
among them; therefore by these 
things they d polluted their inheri- 
tances. 

7. They were slow to hearken 
unto the voice of the Lord their 
God; therefore, the Lord their 
God is e slow to hearken unto 
their prayers, to answer them in 
the day of their trouble. 

8. In the day of their peace 
they esteemed lightly my coun- 
sel; but, in the r day of their 
trouble, of necessity they feel 
after me. 

9. Verily I say unto you, not- 
withstanding their sins, my 
bowels are filled with compassion 
towards them. I will not utterly 
cast them off; and in the day of 
wrath I will "remember mercy. 

10. I have sworn, and the de- 
cree hath gone forth by a former 
commandment which I have 
given unto you, that I would let 
A fall the sword of mine indigna- 
tion in behalf of my people; and 
even as I have said, it shall come 
to pass. 

11. Mine indignation is 4 soon 
to be poured out without meas- 
ure upon all nations; and this 
will I do when the cup of their 
iniquity is full. 

12. And in that day all who 
are found upon the watch-tower, 



or in other words, all mine Israel, 
shall be saved. 

13. And they that have been 
scattered shall be 'gathered. 

14. And all they who have 
mourned shall be ^comforted. 

15. And all they who have 
given their lives for my name 
shall be 'crowned. 

16. Therefore, let your hearts 
be comforted concerning Zion; 
for all flesh is in mine hands; be 
still and know that I am God. 

17. Zion shall not be '"moved 
out of her place, notwithstanding 
her children are scattered. 

18. They that remain, and are 
pure in heart, shall return, and 
come to their inheritances, they 
and their children, with "songs 
of everlasting joy, to build up 
the waste places of Zion — 

19. And all these things that 
the prophets might be fulfilled. 

20. And, behold, there is none 
other place appointed than that 
which I have appointed; neither 
shall there be any other place ap- 
pointed than that which I have 
appointed, for the work of the 
gathering of my saints — 

21. Until the day cometh when 
there is found no more room for 
them; and then I have other 
places which I will appoint unto 
them, and they shall be called 
"stakes, for the curtains or the 
strength of Zion. 

22. Behold, it is my will, that 
all they who call on my name, 
and worship me according to 
mine everlasting gospel, should 
"gather together, and stand in 
holy places; 

23. And prepare for the revela- 
tion which is to come, when the 
veil of the covering of my temple, 
in my tabernacle, which hideth

the earth, shall be taken off, and 
all flesh shall «see me together. 

24. And every corruptible 
thing, both of man, or of the 
beasts of the field, or of the fowls 
of the heavens, or of the fish of 
the sea, that dwells upon all the 
face of the earth, shall be '"con- 
sumed; 

25. And also that of element 
shall 'melt with fervent heat; 
md all things shall become new, 
that my knowledge and 'glory 
may dwell upon all the earth. 

26. And in that day the enmity 
of man, and the "enmity of beasts, 
yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall 
cease from before my face. 

27. And in that day 'whatso- 
ever any mail shall ask, it shall 
be given unto him. 

28. And in that day Satan 
shall not have power w to tempt 
any man. 

29. And there shall be no sor- 
row because there is no death. 

30. In that day an infant shall 
not die 'until he is old; and his 
life shall be as the v age of a tree; 

31. And when he dies he shall 
not sleep, that is to say in the 
earth, but shall be changed in 
the twinkling of an eye, and shall 
be 'caught up, and his rest shall 
be glorious. 

32. Yea, verily I say unto you, 
in that day when the Lord 2a shall 
come, he shall reveal 2ft all 
things — 

33. Things which have passed, 
and hidden things which no man 
knew, things of the earth, by 
which it was made, and the pur- 
pose and the end thereof — 

34. Things most precious, 
things that are above, and things 



that are beneath, things that are 
in the earth, and upon the earth, 
and in heaven. 

35. And all they who suffer 
persecution for my name, and en- 
dure in faith, though they are 
called to lay down their lives for 
my sake yet shall they partake 
of all this glory. 

36. Wherefore, fear not even 
2c unto death; for in this world 
your joy is not full, but in me 
your joy is full. 

37. Therefore, care not for the 
body, neither the life of the body; 
but care for the soul, and for the 
2d life of the soul. 

38. And seek the 2e face of the 
Lord always, that in patience ye 
may possess your souls, and ye 
shall have eternal life. 

39. When men are called unto 
mine everlasting gospel, and cove- 
nant with an everlasting cove- 
nant, they are accounted as the 
2 'salt of the earth and the savor 
of men; 

40. They are called to be the 
savor of men; therefore, if that 
salt of the earth lose its savor, 
behold, it is thenceforth good for 
nothing only to be cast out and 
trodden under the 2 'feet of men. 

41. Behold, here is wisdom 
concerning the children of Zion, 
even many, but not all ; they were 
found transgressors, therefore 
they must needs be chastened — 

42. He that 2 *exalteth himself 
shall be abased, and he that 
abaseth himself shall be exalted. 

43. And now, I will show unto 
you a parable, that you may know 
my will concerning the redemp- 
tion of Zion.

spot of land, very choice; and he 
said unto his servants: Go ye 
unto my "vineyard, even upon 
this very choice piece of land, 
and plant twelve olive-trees; 

45. And set watchmen round 
about them, and build a tower, 
that one may overlook the land 
round about, to be a watchman 
upon the tower, that mine olive- 
trees may not be broken down 
when the enemy shall come to 
spoil and take unto themselves 
the fruit of my vineyard. 

46. Now, the servants of the 
nobleman went and did as their 
lord commanded them, and plant- 
ed the olive-trees, and built a 
hedge round about, and set watch- 
men, and began to build a tower. 

47. And while they were yet 
laying the foundation thereof, 
they began to say among them- 
selves: And what need hath my 
lord of this tower? 

48. And consulted for a long 
time, saying *among themselves: 
What need hath my lord of this 
tower, seeing this is a time of 
peace? 

49. Might not this money be 
given to the exchangers? For 
there is no need of these things. 

50. And while they were at 
variance one with another they 
became very slothful, and they 
hearkened not unto the com- 
mandments of their lord. 

51. And the enemy 2i came by 
night, and broke down the hedge; 
and the servants of the nobleman 
arose and were affrighted, and 
fled; and the enemy destroyed 
their works, and broke down the 
olive-trees. 

52. Now, behold, the noble- 
man, the lord of the vineyard, 
called upon his servants, and said 



unto them, Why! what is the 
cause of this great evil? 

53. Ought ye not to have done 
even as I commanded you, and — 
after ye had planted the vine- 
yard, and built the hedge round 
about, and set watchmen upon 
the walls thereof — built the 
tower also, and set a "watchman 
upon the tower, and watched for 
my vineyard, and not have fallen 
asleep, lest the enemy should 
come upon you? 

54. And behold, the watchman 
upon the tower would have seen 
the 2, enemy while he was yet afar 
off; and then ye could have made 
ready and kept the enemy from 
breaking down the. hedge there- 
of, and saved my vineyard from 
the hands of the destroyer. 

55. And the lord of the vine- 
yard said unto one of his ser- 
vants: Go and gather together 
the residue of my servants, and 
take 2m all the strength of mine 
house, which are my warriors, 
my young men, and they that are 
of middle age also among all my 
servants, who are the strength 
of mine house, save those only 
whom I have appointed to tarry; 

56. And go ye straightway 
unto the land of my vineyard, 
and 2n redeem my vineyard; for 
it is mine; I have bought it with 
money. 

57. Therefore, get ye straight- 
way unto my land; break down 
the walls of mine enemies ; throw 
down their tower, and scatter 
their watchmen. 

58. And inasmuch as they 
gather together against you, 
2o avenge me of mine enemies, 
that by and by I may 2 *come with 
the residue of mine house and 
possess the land.

59. And the servant said unto 
his lord : When shall these things 
be? 

60. And he said unto his ser- 
vant: When I will; go ye straight- 
way, and do all things ^whatso- 
ever I have commanded you; 

61. And this shall be my seal 
and blessing upon you — a faith- 
ful and 2r wise steward in the 
midst of mine house, a ruler in 
my kingdom. 

62. And his servant went 
straightway, and did all things 
whatsoever his lord commanded 
him; and 2 *after many days all 
things were fulfilled. 

63. Again, verily I say unto 
you, I will show unto you 2 'wis- 
dom in me concerning all the 
churches, inasmuch as they are 
willing to be guided in a right 
and proper way for their salva- 
tion — 

64. That the work of the gath- 
ering together of my saints may 
^continue, that I may build them 
up unto my name upon 2c holy 
places; for the time of 2w harvest 
is come, and my word must needs 
be fulfilled. 

65. Therefore, I must gather 
together my people, according to 
the parable of the wheat and the 
tares, that the wheat may be se- 
cured in the garners to possess 
eternal life, and be 2 *crowned 
with celestial glory, when I shall 
''come in the kingdom of my Fa- 
ther to reward every man accord- 
ng as his work shall be; 

66. While the tares shall be 
)ound in 2 *bundles, and their 
&gt;ands made strong, that they may 
te burned with unquenchable fire. 

6 7. Therefore, a commandment 

give unto all the. churches, that 

hey shall continue to 8a gather to- 



gether unto the places which I 
have appointed. 

68. Nevertheless, as I have 
said unto you in a former com- 
mandment, let not your gather- 
ing be in 3b haste, nor by flight; 
but let all things be prepared be- 
fore you. 

69. And in order.that all things 
be prepared before you, observe 
the commandment which I have 
given concerning these things — 

70. Which saith, or teacheth, 
to 3c purchase all the lands with 
money, which can be purchased 
for money, in the region round 
about the land which I have ap- 
pointed to be the land of Zion, 
for the beginning of the gather- 
ing of my saints; 

71. All the land which can be 
purchased in Jackson county, and 
the counties round about, and 
leave the residue in mine hand. 

72. Now, verily I say unto you, 
let all the churches gather to- 
gether 3d all their moneys; let 
these things be done in their 
time, but not in haste; and ob- 
serve to have all things prepared 
before you. 

73. And let honorable men be 
appointed, even 8fl wise men, and 
send them to purchase these 
lands. 

74. And the churches in the 
eastern countries, when they are 
built up, if they will hearken 
unto this counsel they may buy 
lands and gather together upon 
them; and in this way they may 
establish Zion. 

75. There is even now already 
in store sufficient, yea, even an 
abundance, to redeem Zion, and 
establish her waste places, no 
more to be thrown down, were 
the churches, who call themselves

after my name, willing to heark- 
en to my voice. 

76. And again I say unto you, 
those who have been scattered by 
their enemies, it is my will that 
they should continue to ^impor- 
tune for redress, and redemption, 
by the hands of those who are 
placed as rulers and are in au- 
thority over you — 

77. According to the laws and 
constitution of the people, which 
I have suffered to be established, 
and should be maintained for the 
rights and protection of all flesh, 
according to just and holy prin- 
ciples; 

78. That every man may act 
in doctrine and principle pertain- 
ing to futurity, according to the 
moral agency which I have given 
unto him, that every man may 
be accountable for his own sins 
in the day of judgment. 

79. Therefore, it is not right 
that any man should be in '"bond- 
age one to another. 

80. And for this purpose have 
I established the Constitution of 
this land, by the hands of 8A wise 
men whom I raised up unto this 
very purpose, and redeemed the 
land by the shedding of blood. 

81. Now, unto what shall I 
liken the children of Zion? I 
will liken them unto the "parable 
of the woman and the unjust 
judge, for men ought always to 
pray and not to faint, which 
saith — 

82. There was in a city a judge 
which feared not God, neither re- 
garded man. 

83. And there was a widow in 
that city, and she came unto him, 
saying: Avenge me of mine ad- 
versary. 

84. And he would not for a 
while, but afterward he said with- 



in himself: Though I fear not 
God, nor regard man, yet because 
this widow troubleth me I will 
avenge her, lest by her continual 
coming she weary me. 

85. Thus will I liken the chil- 
dren of Zion. 

86. Let them importune at the 
feet of the judge; 

87. And if he heed them not, 
let them importune at the feet of 
the governor; 

88. And if the governor heed 
them not, let them importune at 
the feet of the president; 

89. And if the president heed 
them not, then will the Lord arise 
and come forth out of his ^hid- 
ing place, and in his fury vex the 
nation ; 

90. And in his hot displeasure, 
and in his fierce anger, in his 
time, will cut off those wicked, 
unfaithful, and unjust stewards, 
and appoint them their portion 
among hypocrites, and unbeliev- 
ers; 

91. Even in outer darkness, 
where there is s *weeping, and 
wailing, and gnashing of teeth. 

92. Pray ye, therefore, that 
their ears may be opened unto 
your cries, that I may be merci- 
ful unto them, that these things 
may not come upon them. 

93. What I have said unto you 
must needs be, that all men may 
be left without excuse; 

94. That wise men and rulers 
may hear and know that which 
they have 8, never considered; 

95. That I may proceed to 
bring to pass 8m my act, my strange 
act, and perform my work, my 
strange work, that men may dis- 
cern between the righteous and 
the wicked, saith your God. 

96. And again, I say unto yon, 
it is contrary to my command-

ment and my will that my ser- 
vant Sidney Gilbert should sell 
my storehouse, which I have ap- 
pointed unto my people, into the 
hands of mine enemies. 

97. Let not that which I have 
appointed be polluted by mine 
enemies, by the consent of those 
who call themselves after my 
name; 

98. For this is a very sore and 
grievous sin against me, and 
against my people, in consequence 
of those things which I have de- 
creed and which are soon to be- 
fall the nations. 

99. Therefore, it is my will 



that my people should claim, and 
hold claim upon that which I 
have appointed unto them, though 
they should not be permitted to 
dwell thereon. 

100. Nevertheless, I do not say 
they shall not dwell thereon; for 
inasmuch as they bring forth 
fruit and works meet for my 
kingdom they shall dwell there- 
on. 

101. They shall build, and ^an- 
other shall not inherit it; they 
shall plant vineyards, • and they 
shall eat the fruit thereof. Even 
so. Amen. 



SECTION 102. 



Minutes of the organization of the first High Council of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, at Kirtland, Ohio, Feb- 
ruary 17, 1834. 



1. This day a general council 
of twenty-four high priests as- 
sembled at the house of Joseph 
Smith, Jun., by revelation, and 
proceeded to organize the high 
council of the church of Christ, 
which was to consist of twelve 
high priests, and one or three 
presidents as the case might re- 
quire. 

2. The high council was ap- 
pointed by revelation for the pur- 
pose of settling important diffi- 
culties which might arise in the 
church, which could not be set- 
tled by the church or. the bishop's 
council to the satisfaction of the 
parties. 

3. Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney 
Rigdon and Frederick G. Wil- 
liams were acknowledged presi- 
dents by the voice of the council; 
and Joseph Smith, Sen., John 
Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, 
Martin Harris, John S. Carter, 



Jared Carter, Oliver Cowdery, 
Samuel H. Smith, Orson Hyde, 
Sylvester Smith, and Luke John- 
son, high priests, were chosen to 
be a standing council for the 
church, by the unanimous voice 
of the council. 

4. The above-named councilors 
were then asked whether they ac- 
cepted their appointments, and 
whether they would act in that 
office according to the law of 
heaven, to which they all an- 
swered that they accepted their 
appointments, and would fill their 
offices according to the grace of 
God bestowed upon them. 

5. The number composing the 
council, who voted in the name 
and for the church in appointing 
the above-named councilors were 
forty-three, as follows: nine high 
priests, seventeen elders, four 
priests, and thirteen members. 

6. Voted: that the high coun- 



3n, Tsa. 65:20 — 22. 



178 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 102. 



cil cannot have power to act with- 
out seven of the above-named 
councilors, or their regularly ap- 
pointed successors are present. 

7. These seven shall have 
power to appoint other high 
priests, whom they may consider 
worthy and capable to act in the 
place of absent councilors. 

8. Voted: that whenever any 
vacancy shall occur by the death, 
removal from office for transgres- 
sion, or removal from the bounds 
of this church government, of 
any one of the above-named coun- 
cilors, it shall be filled by the 
nomination of the president or 
presidents, and sanctioned by the 
voice of a general council of high 
priests, convened for that pur- 
pose, to act in the name of the 
church. 

9. The president of the church, 
who is also the president of the 
council, is appointed by revela- 
tion, and acknowledged in his 
administration by the voice of the 
church. 

10. And it is according to the 
dignity of his office that he should 
preside over the council of the 
church; and it is his privilege to 
be assisted by two other presi- 
dents, appointed after the same 
manner that he himself was ap- 
pointed. 

11. And in case of the absence 
of one or both of those who are 
appointed to assist him, he has 
power to preside over the coun- 
cil without an assistant; and in 
case he himself is absent, the 
other presidents have power to 
preside in his stead, both or 
either of them. 

12. Whenever a high council 
of the church of Christ is regu- 
larly organized, according to the 
foregoing pattern, it shall be the 
duty of the twelve councilors to 
cast lots by numbers, and thereby 



ascertain who of the twelve shall 
speak first, commencing with 
number one and so in succession 
to number twelve. 

13. Whenever this council con- 
venes to act upon any case, the 
twelve councilors shall consider 
whether it is a difficult one or 
not; if it is not, two only of the 
councilors shall speak upon it, 
according to the form above writ- 
ten. 

14. But if it is thought to be 
difficult, four shall be appointed; 
and if more difficult, six ; but in 
no case shall more than six be 
appointed to speak. 

15. The accused, in all cases, 
has a right to one-half of the 
council, to prevent insult or in- 
justice. 

16. And the councilors ap- 
pointed to speak before the coun- 
cil are to present the case, after 
the evidence is examined, in its 
true light before the council; and 
every man is to speak according 
to equity and justice. 

17. Those councilors who draw 
even numbers, that is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
10, and 12, are the individuals 
who are to stand up in behalf 
of the accused, and prevent in- 
sult and injustice. 

18. In all cases the accuser and 
the accused shall have a privilege 
of speaking for themselves be- 
fore the council, after the evi- 
dences are heard and the coun- 
cilors who are appointed to speak 
on the case have finished their 
remarks. 

19. After the evidences are 
heard, the councilors, accuser and 
accused have spoken, the presi- 
dent shall give a decision accord- 
ing to the understanding which 
he shall have of the case, and 
call upon the twelve councilors to 
sanction the same by their vote. 

20. But should the remaining 






DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 102. 



179 



councilors, who have not spoken, 
or any one of them, after hear- 
ing the evidences and pleadings 
impartially, discover an error in 
the decision of the president, they 
can manifest it, and the case shall 
have a re-hearing. 

21. And if, after a careful re- 
hearing, any additional light is 
shown upon the case, the decision 
shall he altered accordingly. 

22. But in case no additional 
light is given, the first decision 
shall stand, the majority of the 
council having power to deter- 
mine the same. 

23. In case of difficulty re- 
specting doctrine or principle, if 
there is not a sufficiency written 
to make the case clear to the 
minds of the council, the presi- 
dent may inquire and obtain the 
mind of the Lord by revelation. 

24. The high priests, when 
abroad, have power to call and 
organize a council after the man- 
ner of the foregoing, to settle 
difficulties, when the parties or 
either of them shall request it. 

25. And the said council of 
high priests shall have power to 
appoint one of their own number 
to preside over such council for 
the time being. 

26. It shall be the duty of said 
council to transmit, immediately, 
a copy of their proceedings, with 
a full statement of the testimony 
accompanying their decision, to 
the high council of the seat of the 
First Presidency of the Church. 

27. Should the parties or either 
of them be dissatisfied with the 
decision of said council, they may 
appeal to the high council of the 
seat of the First Presidency of the 
Church, and have a re-hearing, 
which case shall there be con- 
ducted, according to the former 
pattern written, as though no 
such decision had been made. 



28. This council of high priests 
abroad is only to be called on the 
most difficult cases of church mat- 
ters; and no common or ordinary 
case is to be sufficient to call such 
council. 

29. The traveling or located 
high priests abroad have power 
to say whether it is necessary to 
call such a council or not. 

30. There is a distinction be- 
tween the high council of travel- 
ing high priests abroad, and the 
traveling high council composed 
of the twelve apostles, in their 
decisions. 

31. From the decision of the 
former there can be an appeal; 
but from the decision of the lat- 
ter there cannot. 

32. The latter can only be 
called in question by the general 
authorities of the church in case 
of transgression. 

33. Resolved: that the presi- 
dent or presidents of the seat of 
the First Presidency of the 
Church shall have power to de- 
termine whether any such case, 
as may be appealed, is justly 
entitled to a re-hearing, after 
examining the appeal and the 
evidences and statements accom- 
panying it. 

34. The twelve councilors then 
proceeded to cast lots or ballot, 
to ascertain who should speak 
first, and the following was the 
result, namely: 1, Oliver Cow- 
dery; 2, Joseph Coe; 3, Samuel 
H. Smith; 4, Luke Johnson; 5, 
John S. Carter; 6, Sylvester 
Smith; 7, John Johnson; 8, Orson 
Hyde; 9, Jared Carter; 10, Jo- 
seph Smith, Sen. ; 11, John Smith; 
12, Martin Harris. 

After prayer the conference 
adjourned.

SECTION 103. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, 
Ohio, February 24, 1834. For explanation of unusual names see head- 
ing to Section 78. Cause of the persecutions permitted against 

the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri — The Saints to prevail if they 
follow the counsel of the Lord — Otherwise the powers of the world 
to prevail against them — The angel of the Lord and the Lord's presence 
to go before the people — Moneys to be collected and sent up to Zion 
for the purchase of lands — Individual instructions to certain Elders. 



1. Verily I say unto you, my 
friends, behold, I will give unto 
you a revelation and command- 
ment, that you may know how to 
act in the discharge of your duties 
concerning the salvation and "re- 
demption of your brethren, who 
have been scattered on the land 
of Zion; 

2. Being driven and smitten 
by the hands of mine enemies, on 
whom I will pour out my wrath 
without measure in mine own 
time. 

3. For I have suffered them 
thus far, that they might fill up 
the measure of their iniquities, 
that their cup might be full; 

4. And that those who call 
themselves after my name might 
be chastened for a little season 
with a sore and grievous "chas- 
tisement, because they did not 
hearken altogether unto the pre- 
cepts and commandments which 
I gave unto them. 

5. But verily I say unto you, 
that I have decreed a decree 
which my people shall realize, in- 
asmuch as they hearken from this 
very hour unto the counsel which 
I, the Lord their God, shall give 
unto them. 

6. Behold they shall, for I 
have decreed it, c begin to prevail 
against mine enemies from this 
very hour. 



7. And by hearkening to ob- 
serve all the words which I, the 
Lord their God, shall speak unto 
them, they shall never cease to 
prevail until the "kingdoms of 
the world are subdued under my 
feet, and the earth is given unto 
the saints, to "possess it forever 
and ever. 

8. But inasmuch as they keep 
not my commandments, and 
hearken not to observe all my 
words, the 'kingdoms of the 
world shall prevail against them. 

9. For they were set to be a 
light unto the world, and to be 
the saviors of men; 

10. And inasmuch as they are 
not the saviors of men, they are 
"as salt that has lost its savor, 
and is thenceforth good for noth- 
ing but to be cast out and trod- 
den under foot of men. 

11. But verily I say unto you, 
I have decreed that your brethren 
which have been scattered shall 
^return to the lands of their in- 
heritances, and shall build up the 
waste places of Zion. 

12. For after much tribula- 
tion, as I have said unto you in 
a 4 former commandment, cometh 
the blessing. 

13. Behold, this is the blessing 
which I have promised after your 
tribulations, and the tribulations 
of your brethren — your redemp-

tion, and the redemption of your 
brethren, even their 'restoration 
to the land of Zion, to be estab- 
lished, no more to be thrown 
down. 

14. Nevertheless, if they pol- 
lute their inheritances they shall 
be thrown down; for I will not 
Bpare them if they pollute their 
inheritances. 

15. Behold, I say unto you, the 
redemption of Zion must needs 
come by *power; 

16. Therefore, I will 'raise up 
unto my people a man, who shall 
lead them like as Moses led the 
children of Israel. 

17. For ye are the children of 
Israel, and of the seed of Abra- 
ham, and ye must needs be led 
3ut of "bondage by power, and 
with a stretched-out arm. 

18. And as your fathers were 
'led at the first, even so shall the 
redemption of Zion be. 

19. Therefore, let not your 
hearts faint, for I say not unto 
you as I said unto your fathers: 
Mine angel shall go up before 
you, but °not my presence. 

20. But I say unto you: Mine 
angels shall go up before you, 
and *also my presence, and in 
'time ye shall possess the goodly 
land. 

21. Verily, verily I say unto 
you, that my servant Baurak Ale 
[Joseph Smith, Jim.] is the man 
to whom I likened the servant to 
whom the Lord of the vineyard 
spake in the parable which I have 
given unto you. 

22. Therefore let my servant 
Baurak Ale [Joseph Smith, Jun.] 
say unto the 'strength of my 
house, my young men and the 
middle aged — Gather yourselves 



together unto the land of Zion, 
upon the land which I have 
bought with money that has been 
consecrated unto me. 

23. And let all the churches 
send up wise men with their 
moneys, and 'purchase lands even 
as I have commanded them. 

24. And inasmuch as mine en- 
emies come against you to drive 
you from my goodly land, which 
I have consecrated to be the land 
of Zion, even from your 'own 
lands after these testimonies, 
which ye have brought before me 
against them, ye shall "curse 
them; 

25. And whomsoever ye curse, 
I will r curse, and ye shall avenge 
me of mine enemies. 

26. And my presence shall be 
with you even in avenging me of 
mine enemies, unto the "third 
and fourth generation of them 
that hate me. 

27. Let no man be afraid to 
lay down his life for my sake; 
for whoso layeth down 'his life 
for my sake shall find it again. 

28. And whoso is v not willing 
to lay down his life for my sake 
is not my disciple. 

29. It is my will that my ser- 
vant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up 
his voice in the congregations in 
the eastern countries, in prepar- 
ing the churches to keep the com- 
mandments which I have given 
unto them concerning the resto- 
ration and 'redemption of Zion. 

30. It is my will that my ser- 
vant Parley P. Pratt and my ser- 
vant Lyman Wight should not 
return to the land of their breth- 
ren, until they have obtained 
companies to go up unto the land 
of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, 



182 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 104. 



or by fifties, or by an hundred, 
until they have obtained to the 
number of five hundred of the 
2a strength of my house. 

31. Behold this is my will; ask 
and ye shall receive; but men do 
not always do my will. 

32. Therefore, if you cannot 
obtain five hundred, seek dili- 
gently that peradventure you may 
obtain three hundred. 

33. And if ye cannot obtain 
three hundred, seek diligently 
that peradventure ye may obtain 
one hundred. 

34. But verily I say unto you, 
a commandment I give unto you, 
that ye shall not go up unto the 
land of Zion until you have ob- 
tained a hundred of the strength 
of my house, to go up with you 
unto the land of Zion. 

35. Therefore, as I said unto 
you, ask and ye shall receive; 
pray earnestly that peradventure 
my servant Baurak Ale [Joseph 
Smith, Jun.] may go with you, 
and preside in the midst of my 



people, and organize my kingdom 
upon the consecrated land, and 
"establish the children of Zion 
upon the laws and command- 
ments which have been and which 
shall be given unto you. 

36. All victory and glory is 
brought to pass unto you through 
your diligence, faithfulness, and 
prayers of faith. 

37. Let my servant Parley P. 
Pratt journey with my servant 
Joseph Smith, Jun. 

38. Let my servant Lyman 
Wight journey with my servant 
Sidney Rigdon. 

39. Let my servant Hyrum 
Smith journey with my servant 
Frederick G. Williams. 

40. Let my servant Orson Hyde 
journey with my servant Orson 
Pratt, whithersoever my servant 
Joseph Smith, Jun., shall counsel 
them, in obtaining the fulfilment 
of these commandments which 1 
have given unto you, and leave 
the residue in my hands. Even 
so. Amen. 



SECTION 104. 



Revelation given to Enoch [Joseph Smith the Prophet] April 
23, 1834, concerning the United Order, or the order of the Church 
for the benefit of the poor. The occasion was that of a council meet- 
ing of the First Presidency and other High Priests, in which the press- 
ing temporal needs of the people had been given consideration. For 

explanation of unusual names see heading to Section 78. Some 

who had broken their covenants in the United Order had come under 
condemnation — The Lord will not be mocked — Care of the poor an 
imperative duty of the Saints — The United Order in Kirtland was 
segregated from that in Zion, Missouri — This separation partly because 
of transgression on the part of members, and partly because of the 
scattered condition of the Saints in Missouri — A treasury for the order 
provided for — On conditions of faith and humility, the Lord promises 
to deliver his people this once out of financial bondage. 



1. Verily I say unto you, my 
friends, I give unto you counsel, 



and a commandment, concerning 
all the properties which belong 



2a, ver. 22. 101:55. 2b, sec. 42. 



^ 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 104. 



183 



to the order which I commanded 
to be organized and established, 
to be a "united order, and an 
everlasting order for the benefit 
of my church, and for the salva- 
tion of men until I come — 

2. With promise immutable 
and unchangeable, that inasmuch 
as those whom I commanded 
were faithful they should be 
blessed with a multiplicity of 
blessings; 

3. But inasmuch as they were 
not faithful they were nigh unto 
cursing. 

4. Therefore, inasmuch as 
some of my servants have not 
kept the commandment, but have 
broken the covenant through 
covetousness, and with feigned 
words, I 6 have cursed them with 
a very sore and grievous curse. 

5. For I, the Lord, have de- 
creed in my heart, that inasmuch 
as any man belonging to the or- 
der shall be found a transgres- 
sor, or, in other words, shall 
break the covenant with which 
ye are bound, he shall be 'cursed 
in his life, and shall be trodden 
down by whom I will; 

6. For I, the Lord, am not to 
be mocked in these things — 

7. And all this that the inno- 
cent among you may not be con- 
demned with the unjust; and that 
the guilty among you may not 
escape; because I, the Lord, have 
promised unto you a d crown of 
glory at my right hand. 

8. Therefore, inasmuch as you 
are found transgressors, you can- 
not escape my "wrath in your 
lives. 

9. Inasmuch as ye are cut off 
for transgression, ye cannot es- 
cape the 'buffetings of Satan until 
the day of redemption. 

10. And I now give unto you 



power from this very hour, that 
if any man among you, of the 
order, is found a transgressor and 
repenteth not of the evil, that ye 
shall deliver him over unto the 
'buff etings of Satan ; and he shall 
not have power to bring evil upon 
you, 

11. It is wisdom in me; there- 
fore, a commandment I give unto 
you, that ye shall organize your- 
selves and appoint *every man 
his stewardship; 

12. That every man may give 
an account unto me of the stew- 
ardship which is appointed unto 
him. 

13. For it is expedient that I, 
the Lord, should make every man 
accountable, *as a steward over 
earthly blessings, which I have 
made and prepared for my crea- 
tures. 

14. I, the Lord, stretched out 
the heavens, and built the earth, 
my very handiwork; and all 
things therein are mine. 

15. And it is my purpose to 
provide for my saints, for all 
things are mine. 

16. But it must needs be done 
in mine own way; and behold 
this is the way that I, the Lord, 
have decreed to provide for my 
saints, that the poor shall be 
exalted, in that the rich are made 
low. 

17. For the earth is full, and 
there is enough and to spare; 
yea, I prepared all things, and 
have given unto the children of 
men to be agents unto them- 
selves. 

18. Therefore, if any man shall 
take of the abundance which I 
have made, and impart not his 
portion, according to the 'law 
of my gospel, unto the poor and 
the needy, he shall, with the 



the day of redemption. of my gospel, unto the poor and

wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, 
being in torment. 

19. And now, verily I say unto 
you, concerning the properties of 
the order — 

20. Let my servant Pelagoram 
[Sidney Rigdon] have appointed 
unto him the place where he now 
resides, and the lot of Tahhanes 
[the tannery] for his steward- 
ship, for his support while he is 
laboring in my vineyard, even as 
I will, when I shall command 
him. 

21. And let all things be done 
according to the counsel of the 
order, and united consent or voice 
of the order, which dwell in the 
land of Shinehah [Kirtland]. 

22. And this stewardship and 
blessing, I, the Lord, confer upon 
my servant Pelagoram [Sidney 
Rigdon] for a blessing upon him, 
and his seed after him; 

23. And I will multiply bless- 
ings upon him, inasmuch as he 
will be humble before me. 

24. And again, let my servant 
Mahemson [Martin Harris] have 
appointed unto him, for his stew- 
ardship, the lot of land which 
my servant Zombre [John John- 
son] obtained in exchange for his 
former inheritance, for him and 
his seed after him; 

25. And inasmuch as he is 
faithful, I will multiply blessings 
upon him and his seed after him. 

26. And let my servant Ma- 
hemson [Martin Harris] devote 
his moneys for the proclaiming 
of my words,, according as my 
servant Gazelam [Joseph Smith, 
Jun.] shall direct. 

27. And again, let my servant 
Shederlaomach [Frederick G. 
Williams] have the place upon 
which he now dwells. 

28. And let my servant Olihah 
[Oliver Cowdery] have the lot 



which is set off joining the house, 
which is to be for the Laneshine 
house [printing office], which is 
lot number one, and also the lot 
upon which his father resides. 

29. And let my servants She- 
derlaomach [Frederick G. Wil- 
liams] and Olihah [Oliver Cow- 
dery] have the Laneshine house 
[printing office] and all things 
that pertain unto it. 

30. And this shall be their 
stewardship which shall be ap- 
pointed unto them. 

31. And inasmuch as they are 
faithful, behold I will bless, and 
multiply blessings upon them. 

32. And this is the beginning 
of the stewardship which I have 
appointed them, for them and 
their seed after them. 

33. And, inasmuch as they are 
faithful, I will multiply blessings 
upon them and their seed after 
them, even a multiplicity of bless- 
ings. 

34. And again, let my servant 
Zombre [John Johnson] have the 
house in which he lives, and the 
inheritance, all save the ground 
which has been reserved for the 
^building of my houses, which 
pertains to that inheritance, and 
those lots which have been named 
for my servant Olihah [Oliver 
Cowdery]. 

35. And inasmuch as he is 
faithful, I will multiply blessings 
upon him. 

36. And it is my will that he 
should sell the lots that are laid 
off for the building up of the city 
of my saints, inasmuch as it shall 
be made known to him by the 
voice of the Spirit, and according 
to the counsel of the order, and 
by the voice of the order. 

37. And this is the beginning 
of the stewardship which I have 
appointed unto him, for a bless- 



k, sees. 94 and 95.

ing unto him and his seed after 
him. 

38. And inasmuch as he is 
faithful, I will multiply a mul- 
tiplicity of blessings upon him. 

39. And again, let my servant 
Ahashdah [Newel K. Whitney] 
have appointed unto him the 
houses and lot where he now re- 
sides, and the lot and building on 
which the Ozondah [mercantile 
establishment] stands, and also 
the lot which is on the corner 
south of the Ozondah [mercantile 
establishment], and also the lot 
on which the Shule [ashery] is 
situated. 

40. And all this I have ap- 
pointed unto my servant Ahash- 
dah [Newel K. Whitney] for his 
stewardship, for a blessing upon 
him and his seed after him, for 
the benefit of the Ozondah [mer- 
cantile establishment] of my or- 
der which I have established for 
my stake in the land of Shinehah 
[Kirtland]. 

4 1 . Yea, verily, this is the stew- 
ardship which I have appointed 
unto my servant Ahashdah [N. 
K. Whitney], even this whole 
Ozondah [mercantile establish- 
ment] , him and his agent, and his 
seed after him. 

42. And inasmuch as he is 
faithful in keeping my command- 
ments, which I have given unto 
him, I will multiply blessings 
upon him and his seed after him, 
even a multiplicity of blessings. 

43. And again, let my servant 
Gazelam [Joseph Smith, Jim.] 
have appointed unto him the lot 
which is laid off for the f building 
of my house, which is forty rods 
long and twelve wide, and also 
the inheritance upon which his 
father now resides; 

44. And this is the beginning 



of the stewardship which I have 
appointed unto him, for a bless- 
ing upon him, and upon his fa- 
ther. 

45. For behold, I have re- 
served an inheritance for his fa- 
ther, for. his support; therefore 
he shall be reckoned in the house 
of my servant Gazelam [Joseph 
Smith, Jun.]. 

46. And I will multiply bless- 
ings upon the house of my ser- 
vant Gazelam [Joseph Smith, 
Jun.], inasmuch as he is faithful, 
even a multiplicity of blessings. 

47. And now, a commandment 
I give unto you concerning Zion, 
that you shall no longer be bound 
as a m united order to your breth- 
ren of Zion, only on this wise — 

48. After you are organized, 
you shall be called the United 
Order of the "Stake of Zion, the 
City of Shinehah [I^irtland]. And 
your brethren, after they are or- 
ganized, shall be called the United 
Order of the "City of Zion. 

49. And they shall be organ- 
ized in their own names, and in 
their own name; and they shall 
do their business in their own 
name, and in their own names; 

50. And you shall do your 
business in your own name, and 
in your own names. 

51. And this I have com- 
manded to be done for your sal- 
vation, and also for their salva- 
tion, in consequence of their 
being ^driven out and that which 
is to come. 

52. The covenants being bro- 
ken through transgression, by 
covetousness and feigned words — 

53. Therefore, you are dis- 
solved as a ^united order with 
your brethren, that you are not 
bound only up to this hour unto 
them, only on this wise, as I said,

by loan as shall be agreed by this 
order in council, as your circum- 
stances will admit and the voice 
of the council direct. 

54. And again, a command- 
ment I give unto you concerning 
your stewardship which I have 
appointed unto you. 

55. Behold, all these proper- 
ties are mine, or else your faith 
is vain, and ye are found hypo- 
crites, and the covenants which 
ye have made unto me are bro- 
ken; N 

56. And if the properties are 
mine, then ye are stewards; 
otherwise ye are no stewards. 

57. But, verily I say unto you, 
I have appointed unto you to be 
stewards over mine house, even 
stewards indeed. 

58. And for this purpose I 
have commanded you to organize 
yourselves, even to shinelah 
[print] my words, the fulness of 
my 'scriptures, the revelations 
which I have given unto you, and 
which I shall, hereafter, from 
time to time give unto you — 

59. For the purpose of build- 
ing up my church and kingdom 
on the earth, and to prepare my 
people for the time when I shall 
•dwell with them, which is nigh 
at hand. 

60. And ye shall prepare for 
yourselves a place for a treasury, 
and consecrate it unto my name. 

61. And ye shall appoint one 
among you to keep the treasury, 
and he shall be ordained unto 
this blessing. 

62. And there shall be a seal 
upon the treasury, and all the 
sacred things shall be delivered 
into the treasury; and no man 
among you shall call it his own, 
or any part of it, for it shall be- 
long to you all with one accord. 

63. And I give it unto you from 



this very hour; and now see to 
it, that ye go to and make use of 
the stewardship which I have ap- 
pointed unto you, exclusive of the 
sacred things, for the purpose of 
shinelane [printing] these sacred 
things as I have said. 

64. And the avails of the 
sacred things shall be had in the 
treasury, and a seal shall be upon 
it; and it shall not be used or 
taken out of the treasury by any 
one, neither shall the seal be 
loosed which shall be placed upon 
it, only by the voice of the order, 
or by commandment. 

65. And thus shall ye preserve 
the avails of the sacred things in 
the treasury, for sacred and holy 
purposes. 

66. And this shall be called the 
sacred treasury of the Lord; and 
a seal shall be kept upon it that 
it may be holy and consecrated 
unto the Lord. 

67. And again, there shall be 
another treasury prepared, and 
a treasurer appointed to keep the 
treasury, and a seal shall be 
placed upon it; 

68. And all moneys that you 
receive in your stewardships, by 
improving upon the properties 
which I have appointed unto you, 
in houses, or in lands, or in cat- 
tle, or in all things save it be the 
holy and sacred writings, which I 
have reserved unto myself for 
holy and sacred purposes, shall 
be cast into the treasury as fast as 
you receive moneys, by hundreds, 
or by fifties, or by twenties, or 
by tens, or by fives. 

69. Or in other words, if any 
man among you obtain five 
talents [dollars] let him cast 
them into the treasury; or if he 
obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty, or 
an hundred, let him do likewise; 

70. And let not any among you

SECTION 105. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, on Fishipg 
River, Missouri, June 22, 1834. Mob violence against the Saints in 
Missouri had increased; and organized bodies from several counties 
had declared their intent to destroy the people. The Prophet had come 
from Kirtland, at the head of a party known as Zion's Camp, bringing 
clothing and provisions. While this party was encamped on Fishing 
River the Prophet received this revelation. See History of the Church, 
vol. 2, chaps. 5 to 8 inclusive. For explanation of unusual names see 

heading to Section 78. But for their transgressions the people 

might have been redeemed from their enemies — Unwillingness to im- 
part to the poor condemned — The redemption of Zion deferred — The 
people to appeal to the officers of the law for redress — Lands in Jack- 
son and adjoining counties to be purchased — Endowment to be given 
in the House of the Lord in process of erection at Kirtland — The day 
of calling followed by the day of choosing — The Saints to lift an 
ensign of peace. 

obedience, if it must needs be, by 
the things which they suffer. 

7. I speak not concerning those 
who are appointed to lead my peo- 
ple, who are the first elders of my 
church, for they are not all under 
this condemnation; 

8. But I speak concerning my 
churches abroad — there are many 
who will say: Where is their God? 
Behold, he will deliver them in 
time of trouble, otherwise we will 
not go up unto Zion, and will keep 
our moneys. 

9. Therefore, in consequence 
of the transgressions of my peo- 
ple, it is expedient in me that 
mine elders should 'wait for a 
little season for the redemption 
of Zion — 

10. That they themselves may 
be prepared, and that my people 
may be taught more perfectly, 
and have experience, and know 
more perfectly concerning their 
duty, and the things which I re- 
quire at their hands. 



1. Verily I say unto you who 
have assembled yourselves to- 
gether that you may learn my 
will concerning the Redemption 
of mine afflicted people — 

2. Behold, I say unto you, were 
it not for the transgressions of 
my people, speaking concerning 
the church and not individuals, 
they might have been redeemed 
even now. 

3. But behold, they have not 
learned to be obedient to the 
things which I required at their 
hands, but are full of all manner 
of evil, and do not impart of their 
substance, as becometh saints, to 
the poor and afflicted among 
them; 

4. And are not united accord- 
ing to the 6 union required by the 
law of the celestial kingdom; 

5. And Zion cannot be built up 
unless it is by the principles of 
the law of the celestial kingdom ; 
otherwise I cannot receive her 
unto myself. • 

6. And my people must needs 
be chastened until they learn

1 1 . And this cannot be brought 
to pass until mine elders are "en- 
dowed with power from on high. 

12. For behold, I have pre- 
pared a great endowment and 
blessing to be poured out upon 
them, inasmuch as they are faith- 
ful and continue in humility be- 
fore me. 

13. Therefore it is expedient 
In me that mine elders should 
wait for a little season, for the 
redemption of Zion. 

14. For behold, I do not re- 
quire at their hands to 'fight the 
battles of. Zion; for, as I said in 
a former commandment, even so 
will I fulfil — I will fight your bat- 
tles. 

15. Behold, the 'destroyer I 
have sent forth to destroy and 
lay waste mine enemies; and not 
many years hence they shall not 
be left to pollute mine heritage, 
and to blaspheme my name upon 
the lands which I have conse- 
crated for the gathering together 
of my saints. 

16. Behold, I have commanded 
my servant Baurak Ale [Joseph 
Smith, Jun.] to say unto the 
'strength of my house, even my 
warriors, my young men, and 
middle-aged, to gather together 
for the redemption of my people, 
and throw down the towers of 
mine enemies, and scatter their 
watchmen; 

17. But the strength of mine 
house have not hearkened unto 
my words. 

18. But inasmuch as there are 
those who have hearkened unto 
my words, I have prepared a 
blessing and an "endowment for 
them, if they continue faithful. 

19. I have heard their prayers, 
and will accept their offering; 
and it is expedient in me that they 



should be brought thus far for a 
trial of their faith. 

20. And now, verily I say unto 
you, a commandment I give unto 
you, that as many as have come 
up hither, that can stay in the 
region round about, let them 
stay; 

21. And those that cannot stay, 
who have families in the east, let 
them tarry for a little season, in- 
asmuch as my servant Joseph 
shall appoint unto them; 

22. For I will counsel him con- 
cerning this matter, and all things 
whatsoever he shall appoint unto 
them shall be fulfilled. 

23. And let all my people who 
dwell in the regions round about 
be very faithful, and prayerful, 
and humble before me, and re- 
veal not the things which I have 
revealed unto them, until it is 
wisdom in me that they should 
be revealed. 

24. Talk not of judgments, nei- 
ther boast of faith nor of mighty 
works, but carefully gather to- 
gether, as much in one region as 
can be, consistently with the feel- 
ings of the people; 

25. And behold, I will give 
unto you favor and grace in their 
eyes, that you may rest in peace 
and safety, while you are saying 
unto the people: Execute judg- 
ment and justice for us accord- 
ing to law, and *redress us of our 
wrongs. 

26. Now, behold, I say unto 
you, my friends, in this way you 
may find favor in the eyes of the 
people, until the army of Israel 
becomes 'very great. 

27. And I will soften the hearts 
of the people, as I did the heart 
of Pharaoh, from time to time, 
until my servant Baurak Ale 
[Joseph Smith, Jun.] and Ba-

neemy [mine elders], whom I 
have appointed, shall have time 
to gather up the strength of my 
house, 

28. And to have sent wise men, 
to fulfil that which I have com- 
manded concerning the *purchas- 
ing of all the lands in Jackson 
county that can be purchased, 
and in the adjoining counties 
round about. 

29. For it is my will that these 
lands should be purchased; and 
after they are purchased that my 
saints should possess them ac- 
cording to the laws of Consecra- 
tion which I have given. 

30. And after these lands are 
"purchased, I will hold the armies 
of Israel guiltless in taking pos- 
session of their own lands, which 
they have previously purchased 
with their moneys, and of throw- 
ing down the towers of mine en- 
emies that may be upon them, and 
scattering their watchmen, and 
avenging me of mine enemies 
unto the third and fourth genera- 
tion of them that hate me. 

31. But first let my army be- 
come "very great, and let it be 
sanctified before me, that it may 
become "fair as the sun, and clear 
as the moon, and that her ban- 
ners may be terrible unto all na- 
tions; 

32. That the kingdoms of this 
world may be constrained to ac- 
knowledge that the p kingdom of 
Zion is in very deed the kingdom 
of our God and his Christ; there- 
fore, let us become subject unto 
her laws. 



33. Verily I say unto you, it 
is expedient in me that the first 
elders of my church should re- 
ceive their ^endowment from on 
high in my house, which I have 
commanded to be built unto my 
name in the land of Kirtland. 

34. And let those command- 
ments which I have given con- 
cerning Zion and her r law be ex- 
ecuted and fulfilled, after her re- 
demption. 

35. There has been a day of 
calling, but the time has come 
for a day of 'choosing; and let 
those be chosen that are worthy. 

36. And it shall be manifest 
unto my servant, by the voice of 
the Spirit, those that are chosen; 
and they shall be sanctified; 

37. And inasmuch as they fol- 
low the counsel which they re- 
ceive, they shall have power 'after 
many days to accomplish all 
things pertaining to Zion. 

38. And again I say unto you, 
sue for peace, not only to the peo- 
ple that have smitten you, but 
also to all people; 

39. And lift up an ensign of 
peace, and make a proclamation 
of peace unto the ends of the 
earth; 

40. And make proposals for 
peace unto those who have smit- 
ten you, according to the voice of 
the Spirit which is in you, and all 
things shall work together for 
your good. 

41. Therefore, be faithful; and 
behold, and lo, I am with you 
even unto the end. Even so. 
Amen.

Vwelve met in council, confessing their individual weaknesses and 
hortcomings, expressing repentance, and seeking the further guidance 
&gt;/ the Lord. They were about to separate on missions to districts 

issigned. See History of the Church, vol. 2, p. 209. Distinction 

between the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthoods — The right of 
^residency belongs to the Melchizedek Priesthood — High authority of 
he Presidency of the High Priesthood — The Bishopric as the presidency 
)f the Aaronic Priesthood — Duties of the several quorums and of the 
presiding officers thereof — The Twelve constitute the Traveling Presid- 
ing High Council — The Twelve to ordain evangelical ministers, or 
Patriarchs — Descent of the patriarchal order from Adam to Noah — 
Bishops to be chosen from the High Priesthood unless literal descendants 
of Aaron are made known — The order of Church tribunals — No one in 
the Church exempt from accountability.

DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 107. 



2. Why the first is called the 
Melchizedek Priesthood is be- 
cause Melchizedek was such a 
great high priest. 

3. Before his day it was called 
the Holy Priesthood, after the Or- 
der of the Son of God. 

4. But out of respect or rev- 
erence to the name of the Su- 
preme Being, to avoid the too 
frequent repetition of his name, 
they, the church, in ancient days, 
called that priesthood after Mel- 
chizedek, or the Melchizedek 
Priesthood. 

5. All other authorities or of- 
fices in the church are *append- 
ages to this priesthood. 

6. But there are two divisions 
or grand heads — one is the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood, and the 
other is the Aaronic or Levitical 
Priesthood. 

7. The office of an c elder comes 
under the priesthood of Melchiz- 
edek. 

8. The Melchizedek Priesthood 
holds the right of presidency, and 
has power and authority d over all 
the offices in the church in all 
ages of the world, to administer 
in spiritual things. 

9. The Presidency of the High 
Priesthood, after the order of Mel- 
chizedek, have a right to officiate 
in all the offices in the church. 

10. High priests after the or- 
der of the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood have a right to officiate in 
their own standing, under the di- 
rection of the presidency, in ad- 
ministering spiritual things, and 
also in the office of an elder, 
priest (of the Levitical order), 
teacher, deacon, and member. 

11. An elder has a right to 



officiate in his stead when the 
high priest is not present. 

12. The high priest and elder 
are to administer in spiritual 
things, agreeable to the cove- 
nants and commandments of the 
church ; and they have a right to 
officiate in all these offices of the 
church when there are no higher 
authorities present. 

13. The second priesthood is 
called the Priesthood of "Aaron, 
because it was conferred upon 
Aaron and his seed, throughout 
all their generations. 

14. Why it is called the lesser 
priesthood is because it is an 'ap- 
pendage to the greater, or the 
Melchizedek Priesthood, and has 
power in administering outward 
ordinances. 

15. The bishopric is the presi- 
dency of this priesthood, and 
holds the keys or authority of 
the same. 

16. No man has a legal right 
to this office, to hold the keys of 
this priesthood, except he be a 
literal descendant of Aaron. 

17. But as a high priest of the 
Melchizedek Priesthood has au- 
thority to officiate in all the lesser 
offices, he may officiate in the of- 
fice of bishop when no literal de- 
scendant of Aaron can be found, 
provided he is called and set apart 
and ordained unto this power by 
the hands of the 'Presidency of 
the Melchizedek Priesthood. 

18. The power and authority 
of the higher, or Melchizedek 
Priesthood, is to hold the keys of 
all the spiritual blessings of the 
church — 

19. To have^the privilege of 
receiving the ^^mysteries of the

and *presence of God the Father, 
and Jesus the mediator of the

20. The power and authority 
of the lesser, or Aaronic Priest-

minister in outward ordinances,

the several offices in these two 
priesthoods. 

22. Of the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood, "three Presiding High 
Priests, chosen by the body, ap- 
pointed and ordained to that of- 
fice, and upheld by the confidence, 
faith, and prayer of the church, 
form a quorum of the Presidency 
of the Church. 

23. The twelve traveling coun- 
cilors are called to be the Twelve 
Apostles, or special witnesses of 
the name of Christ in all the 
world — thus differing from other 
officers in the church in the duties 
of their calling. 

24. And they form a quorum, 
°equal in authority and power to 
the three presidents previously 
mentioned. 

25. The Seventy are also called 
to preach the gospel, and to be 
especial witnesses unto the Gen- 
tiles and in all the world — thus 
differing from other officers in 
the church in the duties of their 
calling. 



26. And they form a quorum, 
"equal in authority to that of the 
Twelve special witnesses or Apos- 
tles just named. 

27. And every decision made 
by either of these quorums must 
be by the unanimous voice of the 
same; that is, every member in 
each quorum must be agreed to 
its decisions, in order to make 
their decisions of the same power 
or validity one with the other — 

28. A majority may form a 
quorum when circumstances ren- 
der it impossible to be other- 
wise — 

29. Unless this is the case, 
their decisions are not entitled to 
the same blessings which the de- 
cisions of a quorum of three pres- 
idents were anciently, who were 
ordained after the order of Mel- 
chizedek, and were righteous and 
holy men. 

30. The decisions of these 
quorums, or either of them, are 
to be made in all righteousness, 
in holiness, and lowliness of heart, 
meekness and long-suffering, and 
in faith, and virtue, and knowl- 
edge, temperance, patience, god- 
liness, brotherly kindness and 
charity; 

31. Because the promise is, if 
these things abound in them they 
shall not be unfruitful in the 
knowledge of the Lord. 

32. And in case that any de- 
cision of these quorums is made 
in unrighteousness, it may be 
brought before a general assem- 
bly of the several quorums, which 
constitute the spiritual authori- 
ties of the church; otherwise 
there can be no appeal from their 
decision. 

33. The Twelve are a «Travel- 
ing Presiding High Council, to 
officiate in the name of the Lord,

under the direction of the Presi- 
dency of the Church, agreeable 
to the institution of heaven; to 
build up the church, and regulate 
all the affairs of the same in all 
nations, 'first unto the Gentiles 
and 'secondly unto the Jews. 

34. The 'Seventy are to act in 
the name of the Lord, under the 
direction of the Twelve or the 
traveling high council, in build- 
ing up the church and regulating 
all the affairs of the same in all 
nations, first unto the Gentiles 
and then to the Jews; 

35. The Twelve being sent out, 
holding the keys, to open the door 
by the proclamation of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and first unto the 
Gentiles and then unto the Jews. 

36. The standing high coun- 
cils, at the stakes of Zion, form 
a quorum "equal in authority in 
the affairs of the church, in all 
their decisions, to the quorum of 
the presidency, or to the travel- 
ing high council. 

37. The high council in Zion 
form a quorum "equal in authority 
in the affairs of the church, in all 
their decisions, to the councils of 
the Twelve at the stakes of Zion. 

38. It is the duty of the travel- 
ing high council to call upon the 
w Seventy, when they need assis- 
tance, to fill the several calls for 
preaching and administering the 
gospel, instead of any others. 

39. It is the duty of the Twelve, 
in all large branches of the church, 
to ordain 'evangelical ministers, 
as they shall be designated unto 
them by revelation — 

40. The order of this priest- 
hood was confirmed to be handed 
down from father to son, and 
rightly belongs to the literal de- 
scendants of the chosen seed, to 
whom the promises were made. 



41. This order was instituted 
in the days of Adam, and came 
down by lineage in the following 
manner: 

42. From Adam to Seth, who 
was ordained by Adam at the 
age of sixty-nine years, and was 
blessed by him three years pre- 
vious to his (Adam's) death, and 
received the promise of God by 
his father, that his posterity 
should be the chosen of the Lord, 
and that they should be preserved 
unto the end of the earth; 

43. Because he (Seth) was a 
perfect man, and his likeness was 
the express likeness of his father, 
insomuch that he seemed to he 
like unto his father in all things, 
and could be distinguished from 
him only by his age. 

44. Enos was ordained at the 
age of one hundred and thirty- 
four years and four months, by 
the hand of Adam. 

45. God called upon Cainan in 
the wilderness in the fortieth 
year of his age; and he met Adam 
in journeying to the place She- 
dolamak. He was eighty-seven 
years old when he received his 
ordination. 

46. Mahalaleel was four hun- 
dred and ninety-six years and 
seven days old when he was or- 
dained by the hand of Adam, who 
also blessed him. 

47. Jared was two hundred 
years old when he was ordained 
under the hand of Adam, who 
also blessed him. 

48. Enoch was twenty-five 
years old when he was ordained 
under the hand of Adam; and he 
was sixty-five and Adam blessed 
him. 

49. And he saw the Lord, and 
he walked with him, and was be- 
fore his face continually; and he

talked with God three hundred 
ind sixty-five years, making him 
lour hundred and thirty years 
&gt;ld when he was translated. 

50. Methuselah was one hun- 
Ired years old when he was or- 
lained under the hand of Adam. 

51. Lamech was thirty-two 
jrears old when he was ordained 
under the hand of Seth. 

52. Noah was ten years old 
when he was ordained under the 
hand of Methuselah. 

53. Three years previous to 
the death of Adam, he called 
Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, 
Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, 
who were all 'high priests, with 
the residue of his posterity who 
were righteous, into the valley 
of 'Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there 
bestowed upon them his last 
blessing. 

54. And the Lord aB appeared 
unto them, and they rose up and 
blessed Adam, and called him 
"Michael, the prince, the arch- 
angel. 

55. And the Lord administered 
comfort unto Adam, and said unto 
him: I have set thee to be at the 
head; a multitude of nations 
shall come of thee, and thou art 
a * c prince over them forever. 

56. And Adam stood up in the 
midst of the congregation; and, 
notwithstanding he was bowed 
down with age, being full of the 
Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever 
should befall his posterity unto 
the 2d latest generation. 

57. These things were all writ- 
ten in the book of Enoch, and are 
to be testified of in due time. 
..{&gt;8. It is the duty of the Twelve, 
*iso, to ordain and set in order 
*Jl the other officers of the church, 
Agreeable to the revelation which 
^ys: 



59. To the church of Christ 
in the land of Zion, in addition 
to the church laws respecting 
church business — 

60. Verily, I say unto you, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, there 
must needs be ^presiding elders 
to preside over those who are of 
the office of an elder; 

61. And also priests to preside 
over those who are of the office 
of a priest; 

62. And also teachers to pre- 
side over those who are of the 
office of a teacher, in like man- 
ner, and also the deacons — 

63. Wherefore, from deacon to 
teacher, and from teacher to 
priest, and from priest to elder, 
severally as they are appointed, 
according to the covenants and 
commandments of the church. 

64. Then comes the 2r High 
Priesthood, which is the greatest 
of all. 

65. Wherefore, it must needs 
be that one be appointed of the 
High Priesthood to preside over 
the priesthood, and he shall be 
called President of the High 
Priesthood of the Church; 

66. Or, in other words, the 
Presiding High Priest over the 
High Priesthood of the Church. 

67. From the same comes the 
administering of ordinances and 
blessings upon the church, by the 
laying on of the hands. 

68. Wherefore, the oflice of a 
bishop is not equal unto it; for 
the 2 "office of a bishop is in ad- 
ministering all temporal things; 

69. Nevertheless a bishop must 
be chosen from the High Priest- 
hood, unless he is a 8 *literal 
descendant of Aaron; 

70. For unless he is a literal 
descendant of Aaron he cannot 
hold the keys of that priesthood.

71. Nevertheless, a high priest, 
that is, after the order of Mel- 
chizedek, may he set apart 
unto the ministering of temporal 
things, having a knowledge of 
them by the Spirit of truth; 

72. And also to be a judge in 
Israel, to do the business of the 
church, to sit in judgment upon 
transgressors upon testimony as 
it shall be laid before him accord- 
ing to the laws, by the assistance 
of his counselors, whom he has 
chosen or will choose among the 
elders of the church. 

73. This is the duty of a bishop 
who is not a literal descendant of 
Aaron, but has been ordained to 
the High Priesthood after the or- 
der of Melchizedek. 

74. Thus shall he be a judge, 
even a common judge among the 
inhabitants of Zion, or in a stake 
of Zion, or in any branch of the 
church where he shall be set 
apart unto this ministry, until 
the borders of Zion are enlarged 
and it becomes necessary to have 
other bishops or judges in Zion 
or elsewhere. 

75. And inasmuch as there are 
other bishops appointed they shall 
act in the same office. 

76. But a literal descendant of 
Aaron has a legal right to the 
presidency of this priesthood, to 
the keys of this ministry, to act 
in the office of bishop indepen- 
dently, without counselors, ex- 
cept in a case where a President 
of the High Priesthood, after the 
order of Melchizedek, is tried, to 
sit as a judge in Israel. 

77. And the decision of either 
of these councils, agreeable to 
the commandment which says: 

78. Again, verily, I say unto 
you, the most important business 
of the church, and the most diffi- 
cult cases of the church, inasmuch 
as there is not satisfaction upon 



the decision of the bishop or 
judges, it shall be handed over 
and carried up unto the council 
of the church, before the Presi- 
dency of the High Priesthood. 

79. And the Presidency of the 
council of the High Priesthood 
shall have power to call other 
high priests, even twelve, to as- 
sist as counselors; and thus the 
Presidency of the High Priest- 
hood and its counselors shall have 
power to decide upon testimony 
according to the laws of the 
church. 

80. And after this decision it 
shall be had in remembrance no 
more before the Lord; for this is 
the highest council of the church 
of God, and a final decision upon 
controversies in spiritual matters. 

81. There is not any person be- 
longing to the church who is 
exempt from this council of the 
church. 

82. And inasmuch as a Presi- 
dent of the High Priesthood shall 
transgress, he shall be had in re- 
membrance before the common 
council of the church, who shall 
be assisted by twelve counselors 
of the High Priesthood; 

83. And their decision upon 
his head shall be an end of con- 
troversy concerning him. 

84. Thus, none shall be ex- 
empted from the justice and the 
laws of God, that all things may 
be done in order and in solemnity 
before him, according to truth 
and righteousness. 

85. And again, verily I say 
unto you, the duty of a president 
over the office of a deacon is to 
preside over twelve deacons, to 
sit in council with them, and to 
teach them their duty, edifying 
one another, as it is given accord- 
ing to the covenants. 

86. And also the duty of the 
president over the office of the 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 108. 



197 



teachers is to preside over twenty- 
four of the teachers, and to sit in 
council with them, teaching them 
the duties of their office, as given 
in the covenants. 

87. Also the duty of the presi- 
dent over the Priesthood of Aaron 
is to preside over forty-eight 
priests, and sit in council with 
them, to teach them the duties 
of their office, as is given in the 
covenants — 

88. This president is to be a 
bishop; for this is one of the 
duties of this priesthood. 

89. Again, the duty of the 
president over the office of elders 
is to preside over ninety-six eld- 
ers, and to sit in council with 
them, and to teach them accord- 
ing to the covenants. 

90. This presidency is a dis- 
tinct one from that of the seventy, 
and is designed for those who do 
not travel into all the world. 

91. And again, the duty of the 
President of the office of the High 
Priesthood is to preside over the 
whole church, and to be like unto 
Moses — 

92. Behold, here is wisdom; 
yea, to be a 2i seer, a revelator, 
a translator, and a prophet, hav- 
ing all the gifts of God which he 
bestows upon the head of the 
church. 

93. And it is according to the 
vision showing the order of the 
■'Seventy, that they should have 



seven presidents to preside over 
them, chosen out of the number 
of the seventy; 

94. And the seventh president 
of these presidents is to preside 
over the six; 

95. And these seven presidents 
are to choose other seventy be- 
sides the first seventy to whom 
they belong, and are to preside 
over them; 

96. And also other seventy, 
until seven times seventy, if the 
labor in the vineyard of necessity 
requires it. 

97. And these seventy are to 
be traveling ministers, unto the 
Gentiles first and also unto the 
Jews. 

98. Whereas other officers of 
the church, who belong not 
unto the Twelve, neither to the 
Seventy, are not under the re- 
sponsibility to travel among all 
nations, but are to travel as their 
circumstances shall allow, not- 
withstanding they may hold as 
high and responsible offices in 
the church. 

99. Wherefore, now let every 
man learn his duty, and to act in 
the office in which he is ap- 
pointed, in all diligence. 

100. He that is slothful shall 
not be counted worthy to stand, 
and he that learns not his duty 
and shows himself not approved 
shall not be counted worthy to 
stand. Even so. Amen.

ordination with the rest of mine

5. Behold, this is the promise 
of the Father unto you if you 
continue faithful. 

6. And it shall be fulfilled 
upon you in that day that you 
shall have right to preach my 
gospel wheresoever I shall send 
you, from henceforth from that 
time. 

7. Therefore, strengthen your 
brethren in all your conversation, 
in all your prayers, in all your 
exhortations, and in all your 
doings. 

8. And behold, and lo, I am 
with you to bless you and de- 
liver you forever. Amen.

Prayer offered at the dedication of the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, 
March 27, 1836. According to the Prophet's written statement, this 
prayer was given to him by revelation. See History of the Church, 
vol 2, p. 410. 



1. Thanks be to thy name, O 
Lord God of Israel, who keepest 
covenant and showest mercy unto 
thy servants who walk upright- 
ly before thee, with all their 
hearts — 

2. Thou who hast a commanded 
thy servants to build a house to 
thy name in this place [Kirt- 
land]. 

3. And now thou beholdest, O 
Lord, that thy servants have 
done according to thy command- 
ment. 

4. And now we ask thee, Holy 
Father, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, the Son of thy bosom, in 
whose name alone salvation can 
be administered to the children 
of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to 
accept of this house, the work- 
manship of the hands of us, thy 



servants, which thou didst com- 
mand us to build. 

5. For thou knowest that we 
have done this work through 
great tribulation; and out of our 
poverty we have given of our 
substance to build a house to thy 
name, that the Son of Man might 
have a place to manifest himself 
to his people. 

6. And as thou hast said in a 
^revelation, given to us, calling 
us thy frifends, saying — Call your 
solemn assembly, as I have com- 
manded you; 

7. And as all have not faith, 
seek ye diligently and teach one 
another words of wisdom; yea, 
seek ye out of the best books 
words of wisdom, seek learning 
even by study and also by faith; 

8. Organize yourselves; pre-

pare every needful thing, and es- 
tablish a house, even a house of 
prayer, a house of fasting, a house 
of faith, a house of learning, a 
bouse of glory, a house of order, 
a house of God; 

9. That your incomings may 
be in the name of the Lord, that 
your outgoings may be in the 
name of the Lord, that all your 
salutations may be in the name 
of the Lord, with uplifted hands 
unto the Most High — 

10. And now, Holy Father, we 
ask thee to assist us, thy people, 
-with thy grace, in calling our 
c solemn assembly, that it may be 
done to thine honor and to thy 
divine acceptance; 

11. And in a manner that we 
may be found worthy, in thy 
sight, to secure a fulfilment of 
the promises which thou hast 
made unto us, thy people, in the 
revelations given unto us; 

12. That thy glory may rest 
down upon thy people, and upon 
this thy house, which we now 
dedicate to thee, that it may be 
sanctified and consecrated to be 
holy, and that thy holy pres- 
ence may be continually in this 
house; 

13. And that all people who 
shall enter upon $he threshold of 
the Lord's house may feel thy 
power, and feel constrained to 
acknowledge that thou hast sanc- 
tified it, and that it is thy house, 
a place of thy holiness. 

14. And do thou grant, Holy 
Father, that all those who shall 
worship in this house may be 
taught words of wisdom out of 
the 'best books, and that they 
may seek learning even by study, 
and also by faith, as thou hast 
said; 

15. And that they may grow up 
in thee, and receive a fulness of

ff, see b, sec. 1. 



the Holy Ghost, and be organized 
according to thy laws, and be 
prepared to obtain every needful 
thing; 

16. And that this house may 
be a house of prayer, a house of 
fasting, a house of faith, a house 
of glory and of God, even thy 
house; 

17. That all the incomings of 
thy people, into this house, may 
be in the name of the Lord; 

18. That all their outgoings 
from this house may be in the 
name of the Lord; 

19. And that all their saluta- 
tions may be in the name of the 
Lord, with holy hands, uplifted 
to the Most High; 

20. And that no 'unclean thing 
shall be permitted to come into 
thy house to pollute it; 

21. And when thy people trans- 
gress, any of them, they may 
speedily repent and return unto 
thee, and find favor in thy sight, 
and be restored to the blessings 
which thou hast ordained to be 
poured out upon those who shall 
reverence thee in thy house. 

22. And we ask thee, Holy Fa- 
ther, that thy servants may go 
forth from this house armed with 
thy power, and that thy name 
may be upon them, and thy 
glory be round about them, and 
thine 'angels have charge over 
them; 

23. And from this place they 
may bear exceedingly great and 
glorious tidings, in truth, unto 
the 'ends of the earth, that they 
may know that this is thy work, 
and that thou hast put forth thy 
hand, to fulfil that which thou 
hast spoken by the mouths of 
the prophets, concerning the last 
days. 

24. We ask thee, Holy Father, 
to establish the people that shall

worship, and honorably hold a 
name and standing in this thy 
house, to all generations and for 
eternity; 

25. That no weapon *formed 
against them shall prosper; that 
he who diggeth a pit for them 
shall fall into the same himself; 

26. That no combination of 
wickedness shall have power to 
rise up and prevail over thy peo- 
ple upon whom thy name shall 
be put in this house; 

27. And if any people shall 
i rise against this people, that 
thine anger be kindled against 
them; 

28. And if they shall smite this 
people thou wilt smite them; 
thou wilt fight for thy people as 
thou didst in the day of battle, 
that they may be delivered from 
the hands of all their enemies. 

2$. We ask thee, Holy Father, 
to confound, and astonish, and to 
bring to 'shame and confusion, 
all those who have spread lying 
reports abroad, over the world, 
against thy servant or servants, 
if they will not repent, when the 
*everlasting gospel shall be pro- 
claimed in their ears; 

30. And that all their works 
may be brought to naught, and 
be swept away by the 'hail, and 
by the judgments which thou wilt 
send upon them in thine anger, 
that there may be an m end to ly- 
ings and slanders against thy peo- 
ple. 

31. For thou knowest, O Lord, 
that thy servants have been in- 
nocent before thee in bearing 
record of thy name, for which 
they have suffered these things. 

32. Therefore we plead be- 
fore thee for a full and com- 
plete deliverance from under this 
yoke; 



33. Break it off, O Lord; break 
it off from the necks of thy ser- 
vants, by thy power, that we may 
rise up in the midst of this gen- 
eration and do thy work. 

34. O Jehovah, have mercy 
upon this people, and as all men 
sin forgive the transgressions of 
thy people, and let them be blot- 
ted out forever. 

35. Let the "anointing of thy 
ministers be sealed upon them 
with power from on high. 

36. Let it be fulfilled upon 
them, as upon those on the day 
of Pentecost; let the *gift of 
tongues be poured out upon thy 
people, even cloven tongues as 
of fire, and the interpretation 
thereof. 

37. And let thy house be filled, 
as with a rushing mighty wind, 
with thy glory. 

38. Put upon thy servants the

servants shall enter, and the peo-

testimony of thy servants, and 
thy servants warn them to save 
themselves from this untoward 
generation, let it he upon that 
sity according to that which thou 
hast spoken by the mouths of thy 
prophets. 

42. But deliver thou, O Jeho- 
vah, we beseech thee, thy servants 
from their hands, and cleanse 
them from their blood. 

43. O Lord, we delight not in 
the destruction of our fellow 
men; their souls are precious be- 
fore thee; 

44. But thy word must be ful- 
filled. Help thy servants to say, 
with thy grace assisting them: 
Thy will be done, O Lord, and not 
ours. 

45. We know that thou hast 
spoken by the mouth of thy 
prophets terrible things concern- 
ing the wicked, in the last days — 
that thou wilt pour out thy judg- 
ments, without measure; 

46. Therefore, O Lord, deliver 
thy people from the calamity of 
the wicked; enable thy servants 
to 'seal up the law, and bind up 
the testimony, that they may be 
prepared against the day of burn- 
ing. 

47. We ask thee, Holy Father, 
to remember those who have been 
driven by the inhabitants of Jack- 
son county, Missouri, from the 
lands of their inheritance, and 
break off, O Lord, this yoke of 
affliction that has been put upon 
them. 

48. Thou knowest, O Lord, 
that they have been greatly op- 
pressed and afflicted by wicked 
men ; and our hearts flow out with 
sorrow because of their grievous 
burdens. 

49.. O Lord, how long wilt thou 



suffer this people to bear this 
affliction, and the cries of their 
innocent ones to ascend up in 
thine ears, and their blood come 
up in testimony before thee, and 
not make a display of thy testi- 
mony in their behalf? 

50. Have mercy, O Lord, upon 
the wicked mob, who have driven 
thy people, that they may cease 
to spoil, that they may repent 
of their sins if repentance is to 
be found; 

51. But if they will not, make 
bare thine arm, O Lord, and 're- 
deem that which thou didst ap- 
point a Zion unto thy people. 

52. And if it cannot be other- 
wise, that the cause of thy people 
may not fail before thee u may 
thine anger be kindled, and thine 
indignation fall upon them, that 
they may be wasted away, hpth 
root and branch, from under 
heaven ; 

53. But inasmuch as they will 
repent, thou art gracious and 
merciful, and wilt turn away thy 
wrath when thou lookest upon 
the face of thine Anointed. 

54. Have mercy, O Lord, upon 
all the nations of the earth; have 
mercy upon the rulers of our 
land; may those principles, which 
were so honorably and nobly de- 
fended, namely, the ^Constitution 
of our land, by our fathers, be 
established forever. 

55. Remember the kings, the 
princes, the nobles, and the great 
ones of the earth, and all people, 
and the qhurches, all the poor, 
the needy, and afflicted ones of 
the earth; 

56. That their hearts may he 
softened when thy servants shall 
go out from thy house, O Je- 
hovah, to bear testimony of thy 
name; that their prejudices may 
give way before the truth, and

that thou hast sent us; 

5S. That from among all these, 
thy servants, the sons of Jacob, 
may gather out the righteous to 
build a 'holy city to thy name, as 
thou hast commanded them. 

59. We ask thee to appoint 
unto Zion other ''stakes besides 
this one which thou hast ap- 
pointed, that the gathering of thy 
people may roll on in great power 
and majesty, that thy work may 
he cut short in righteousness. 

60. Now these words, Lord, 
we have spoken before thee, con- 
cerning the revelations and com- 
mandments which thou hastgiven 
unto ua, who are identified with 
the Gentiles. 

61. But thouknowest that thou 
hast a great love for the children 
of Jacob, who have been scattered 
upon the mountains for a long 
time, in a cloudy and dark day. 

62. We therefore ask thee to 
have mercy upon the children of 
Jacob, that Jerusalem, from 'this 
liour, may begin to bo redeemed; 

63. And the yoke of bondage 
may begin to be broken off from 
the house of David; 

64. And the children of Judah 
may begin to return to the lands 
which thou didst give to Abra- 
ham, their father. 

65. And cause that the "rem- 
nants of Jacob, who have been 
cursed and smitten because of 
their transgression, be converted 
from their wild and savage con- 
dition to the fulness of the ever- 
lasting gospel; 

6B. That they may lay down 
their weapons of bloodshed, and 
(ease their rebellions. 



67. And may all the scattered 
remnants of Israel, who haie 
been driven to the ends of the 
earth, come to a knowledge of lb 
truth, believe In the Messiah, 8 
be redeemed from oppression, aci 
rejoice before thee. 

88. O Lord, remember thy ser- 
vant, Joseph Smith, Jun., and all 
his afflictions and persecutions- 
how he has covenanted with Je- 
hovah, and vowed to thee, C 
Mighty God of Jacob — and tbe 
commandments which thou hast 
given unto him, and that be hath 
sincerely striven to do thy will.

his wife and children, that the;

immediate connections, that their

swept away as with a, flood; that

dents of thy church, that thy

mediate connections, that their

as the moon, clear as the sun, and

thy presence, and the valleys to 
be exalted, the rough places made 
smooth; that thy glory may fill 
the earth;

caught up in the cloud to meet 
thee, that we may ever be with

pure, that we may be clothed

with palms in our hands, and 
crowns of glory upon our heads, 
and reap eternal joy for all our 
sufferings. 

77. O Lord God Almighty,

and answer us from heaven, thy 
holy habitation, where thou sit- 
test enthroned, with glory, honor, 
power, majesty, might, dominion, 
truth, justice, judgment, mercy,

tions, and accept the dedication 
of this house unto thee, the work 
of our hands, which we have built 
unto thy name; 

79. And also this church, to

us by the power of thy Spirit,

tions of praise, singing Hosanna

Visions manifested to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Oliver 
Cowdery, in the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, April 3, 1836. The occa- 
sion was that of a Sabbath day meeting. The Prophet prefaces his 
record of the manifestations with these words: In the afternoon, I 
assisted the other presidents in distributing the Lord's Supper to the 
Church, receiving it from the Twelve, whose privilege it was to officiate 
at the sacred desk this day. After having performed this service to 
my brethren, I retired to the pulpit, the veils being dropped, and bowed 
myself, with Oliver Cowdery, in solemn and silent prayer. After rising 
from prayer, the following vision was opened to both of us. Per- 
sonal manifestations of the Lord Jesus Christ — His acceptance of the 
Temple — Visitation by Moses and his commitment of the keys of the 
gathering — Visitation by Elias and his conferment of authority — Visita- 
tion by Elijah in direct fulfilment of Malachi's prediction. 



1. The "veil was taken from 
our minds, and the eyes of our 
understanding were opened. 

2. We *saw the Lord standing 



upon the breastwork of the pul- 
pit, before us; and under his feet 
was a paved work of pure gold, 
in color like amber.

3. His eyes were as a flame of 
fire; the hair of his head was 
white like the pure snow; his 
countenance shone above the 
brightness of the sun; and his 
voice was as the sound of the 
rushing of great waters, even the 
voice of Jehovah, saying: 

4. I am the first and the last; 
I am he who liveth, I am he who 
was slain; I am your c advocate 
with the Father. 

5. Behold, your sins are for- 
given you; you are clean before 
me; therefore, lift up your heads 
and rejoice. 

6. Let the hearts of your breth- 
ren rejoice, and let the hearts of 
all my people rejoice, who have, 
with their might, built this house 
to my name. 

7. For behold, I have accepted 
this house, and my name shall be 
here; and I will manifest myself 
to my people in mercy in this 
house. 

8. Yea, I will ^appear unto my 
servants, and speak unto them 
with mine own voice, if my people 
will keep my commandments, and 
do not pollute this holy house. 

9. Yea the hearts of thousands 
and tens of thousands shall great- 
ly rejoice in consequence of the 
blessings which shall be poured 
out, and the 'endowment with 
which my servants have been en- 
dowed in this house. 

10. And the fame of this house 
shall spread to foreign lands ; and 
this is the beginning of the bless- 



ing which shall be poured out 
upon the heads of my people. 
Even so. Amen. 

11. After this vision closed, 
the heavens were again opened 
unto us; and Moses appeared be- 
fore us, and committed unto us 
the 'keys of the gathering of 
Israel from the four parts of the 
earth, and the leading of the 
'ten tribes from the land of the 
north. 

12. After this, *Elias appeared, 
and committed the dispensation 
of the gospel of Abraham, say- 
ing that in us and *our seed all 
generations after us should be 
blessed. 

1 3 . After this vision had closed, 
another great and glorious vision 
burst upon us; for 'Elijah the 
prophet, who was taken to heaven 
without tasting death, stood be- 
fore us, and said: 

14. Behold, the time has fully 
come, which was spoken of by 
the mouth of Malachi — testify- 
ing that he [Elijah] should be 
sent, before the great and dread- 
ful day of the Lord come — 

15. To turn the hearts of the 
^fathers to the children, and the 
children to the fathers, lest the 
whole earth be smitten with a 
curse — 

16. Therefore, the keys of this 
dispensation are committed into 
your hands; and by this ye may 
know that the great and dread- 
ful day of the Lord is 'near, even 
at the doors.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Thomas 
B. Marsh, at Kirtland, Ohio, July 23, 1837. The word of the Lord 
unto Thomas B. Marsh, concerning the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. 
The Prophet records that this revelation was received on the day on 
which the Gospel was first preached in England. Thomas B. Marsh 

was at this time president of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 

The Twelve to send the gospel abroad among all nations — They are to 
act under the direction of the First Presidency — Others may be author- 
ized by the Twelve for ministry among the nations — The keys of power 
in the Priesthood committed to the First Presidency and the Twelve — 
The present designated as the dispensation of the fulness of times. 



1. Verily thus saith the Lord 
unto you my servant Thomas: I 
have heard thy prayers; and 



thine alms have come up as a 
memorial before me, in behalf of 
those, thy brethren, who were 



64:27 — 29. See 2a, sec. 42. 



206

chosen to bear testimony of my 
name and to a send it abroad 
among all nations, kindreds, 
tongues, and people, and ordained 
through the instrumentality of 
my servants. 

2. Verily I say unto you, there 
have been some few things in 
thine heart and with thee with 
which I, the Lord, was not well 
pleased. 

3. Nevertheless, inasmuch as 
thou hast abased thyself thou 
shalt be exalted; therefore, all 
thy sins are forgiven thee. 

4. Let thy heart be of good 
cheer before my face; and thou 
shalt bear record of my name, 
not only unto the Gentiles, but 
also unto the Jews; and thou 
shalt send forth my word unto 
the ends of the earth. 

5. Contend thou, therefore, 
morning by morning; and day 
after day let thy warning voice 
go forth; and when the night 
cometh let not the inhabitants of 
the earth slumber, because of thy 
speech. 

6. Let thy habitation be known 
in Zion, and remove not thy 
house; for I, the Lord, have a 
great work for thee to do, in pub- 
lishing my name among the chil- 
dren of men. 

7. Therefore, gird up thy loins 
for the work. Let thy feet be 
shod also, for thou art chosen, 
and thy path lieth among the 
mountains, and among many na- 
tions. 

8. And by thy word many high 
ones shall be brought low, and 
by thy word many low ones shall 
be exalted. 

9. Thy voice shall be a rebuke 
unto the transgressor; and at thy 
rebuke let the tongue of the slan- 
derer cease its perverseness. 

10. Be thou humble; and the 



Lord thy God shall lead thee by 
the hand, and give thee answer 
to thy prayers. 

11. I know thy heart, and have 
heard thy prayers concerning thy 
brethren. Be not partial towards 
them in love above many others, 
but let thy love be for them as for 
thyself; and let thy love abound 
unto all men, and unto all who 
love my name. 

12. And pray for thy brethren 
of the Twelve. Admonish them 
sharply for my name's sake, and 
let them be admonished for all 
their sins, and be ye faithful be- 
fore me unto my name. 

13. And after their tempta- 
tions, and much tribulation, be- 
hold, I, the Lord, will feel after 
them, and if they harden not 
their hearts, and stiffen not their 
necks against me, they shall be 
converted, and I will heal them. 

14. Now, I say unto you, and 
what I say unto you, I say unto 
all the ^Twelve: Arise and gird 
up your loins, take up your cross, 
follow me, and feed my sheep. 

15. Exalt not' yourselves; rebel 
not against my servant Joseph; 
for verily I say unto you, I am 
with him, and my hand shall be 
over him; and the c keys which 
I have given unto him, and also 
to youward, shall not be taken 
from him till I come. 

16. Verily I say unto you, my 
servant Thomas, thou art the man 
whom I have chosen to hold the 
keys of my kingdom, as pertain- 
ing to the Twelve, abroad among 
all nations — 

17. That thou mayest be my 
servant to unlock the door of the 
kingdom in all places where my 
servant Joseph, and my servant 
Sidney, and my servant Hyrum, 
cannot come; 

18. For on them have I laid

for a little season. 

19. Wherefore, whithersoever 
they shall send you, go ye, and I 
will be with you; and in whatso- 
ever place ye shall proclaim my 
name an effectual door shall be 
opened unto you, that they may 
receive my word. 

20. Whosoever receiveth my 
word receiveth me, and whoso- 
ever receiveth me, receiveth 
those, the First Presidency, whom 
I have sent, whom I have made 
counselors for my name's sake 
unto you. 

21. And again, I say unto you, 
that whosoever ye shall send in 
my name, by the voice of your 
brethren, the Twelve, duly recom- 
mended and authorized by you, 
shall have d power to open the 
door of my kingdom unto any 
nation whithersoever ye shall 
send them — 

22. Inasmuch as they shall 
humble themselves before me, 
and abide in my word, and heark- 
en to the voice 'of my Spirit. 

23. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, 'darkness covereth the earth, 
and gross darkness the minds of 
the people, and 'all flesh has be- 
come corrupt before my face. 

24. Behold, 'vengeance Com- 
eth speedily upon the inhabitants 
of the earth, a day of wrath, a 
day of burning, a day of desola- 
tion, of weeping, of mourning, 
and of lamentation; and as a 
whirlwind it shall come upon all 
the face of the earth, saith the 
Lord. 

25. And upon my house *shall 
it begin, and from my house shall 
it go forth, saith the Lord; 

26. First among those among 
you, saith the Lord, who have 
professed to know my name and 



have not known me, and have 
blasphemed against me in the 
midst of my house, saith the 
Lord. 

27. Therefore, see to it that 
ye trouble not yourselves con- 
cerning the affairs of my church 
in this place, saith the Lord. 

28. But purify your hearts be- 
fore me; and then *go ye into all 
the world, and preach my gospel 
unto every creature who has not 
received it; 

29. And 'he that believeth and 
is baptized shall be saved, and he 
that believeth not, and is not bap- 
tized, shall be damned. 

30. For unto you, the Twelve, 
and those, the First Presidency, 
who are appointed with you to 
be your counselors and your lead- 
ers, is the power of this priest- 
hood given, for the last days and 
for the last time, in the which is 
the ^dispensation of the fulness of 
times. 

31. Which power you hold, in 
connection with all those who 
have received a dispensation at 
any time from the beginning of 
the creation; 

32. For verily I say unto you, 
the 'keys of the dispensation, 
which ye have received, have 
come down from the fathers, and 
last of all, being sent down from 
heaven unto you. 

33. Verily I say unto you, be- 
hold how great is your calling. 
Cleanse your hearts and your gar- 
ments, lest the blood of this 
generation be required at your 
hands. 

34. Be faithful until I come, 
for I "come quickly; and my re- 
ward is with me to recompense 
every man according as his work 
shall be. I am Alpha and Omega.

Answers to certain questions on Scripture, given by Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, March, 1838. 



1. Who is the Stem of Jesse 
spoken of in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 
and 5 th verses of the 11th chap- 
ter of Isaiah? 

2. Verily thus saith the Lord: 
It is Christ. 

3. What is the rod spoken of 
in the first verse of the 11th 
chapter of Isaiah, that should 
come of the Stem of Jesse? 

4. Behold, thus saith the Lord: 
It is a servant in the hands of 
Christ, who is partly a descendant 
of Jesse as well as of Ephraim, 
or of the house of Joseph, on 
whom there is laid much power. 

5. What is the root of Jesse 
spoken of in the 10th verse of 
the 11th chapter? 

6. Behold, thus saith the Lord, 
it is a descendant of Jesse, as well 
as of Joseph, unto whom rightly 
belongs the priesthood, and the 
keys of the kingdom, for an "en- 
sign, and for the gathering of my 
people in the last days. 

7. Questions by Elias Higbee: 
What is meant by the command 
in Isaiah, 5 2d chapter, 1st verse, 



which saith: Put on thy strength, 
O Zion — and what people had 
Isaiah reference to? 

8. He had reference to those 
whom God should call in the last 
days, who should hold the power 
of priesthood to bring again Zion, 
and the redemption of Israel; 
and to put on her strength is to 
put on the authority of the priest- 
hood, which she, Zion, has a right 
to by lineage; also to return to 
that power which she had lost. 

9. What are we to understand 
by Zion loosing herself from the 
bands of her neck; 2d verse? 

10. We are to understand that 
the scattered ^remnants are ex- 
horted to return to the Lord from 
whence they have fallen; which 
if they do, the promise of the 
Lord is that he will speak to 
them, or give them revelation. 
See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. 
The bands of her neck are the 
curses of God upon her, or the 
remnants of Israel in their scat* 
tered condition among the Gen- 
tiles.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Far West, 
Missouri, April 17, 1838. Directions to David W. Patten — Posi- 
tions occupied by the unfaithful to be given to others. 



1. Verily thus saith the Lord: 
It is wisdom in my servant David 
W. Patten, that he settle up all 
his business as soon as he pos- 
sibly can, and make a disposition 
of his merchandise, that he may 
perform a mission unto me next 
spring, in company with others, 
even twelve including himself, to 



testify of my name and bear glad 
tidings unto all the world.

Lord, that inasmuch as there are

name, others shall be planted in 
their stead and receive their 
bishopric. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Far West, 
Missouri, April 26, 1838, making known the will of God concerning 
the building up of that place, and of the Lord's House, This revela- 
tion is addressed to the presiding officers of the Church, The 

official name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, con- 
firmed by the Lord — Far West to be a holy and consecrated place — 
Commandment to build a house of the Lord there — The First Presi- 
dency not to incur debts for the building of a house unto the Lord, 



1. Verily thus saith the Lord 
unto you, my servant Joseph 
Smith, Jun., and also my servant 
Sidney Rigdon, and also my ser- 
vant Hyrum Smith, and your 
counselors who are and shall be 
appointed hereafter; 

2. And also unto you, my ser- 
vant Edward Partridge, and his 
counselors; 

3. And also unto my faithful 
servants who are of the high 
council of my church in Zion, for 
thus it shall be called, and unto 
all the elders and people of my 
"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, scattered abroad in 
all the world; 

4. For thus shall my church be 
called in the last days, even The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day "Saints. 

5. Verily I say unto you all: 
Arise and shine forth, that thy 
light may be a "standard for the 
nations; 

6. And that the gathering to- 
gether upon the land of Zion, and 
upon her stakes, may be for a 
'defense, and for a refuge from 
the storm, and from wrath when 
it shall be 'poured out without 
mixture upon the whole earth. 

7. Let the city, Far West, be 
a holy and consecrated land unto 
me; and it shall be called most 



holy, for the ground upon which 
thou standest is holy. 

8. Therefore, I command you 
to build a house unto me, for the 
gathering together of my saints, 
that they may worship me. 

9. And let there be a beginning 
of this work, and a foundation, 
and a preparatory work, this fol- 
lowing summer; 

10. And let the beginning be 
made on the fourth day of July 
next; and from that time forth 
let my people labor diligently to 
build a house unto my name; 

11. And in one year from this 
day let them 're-commence lay- 
ing the foundation of my house. 

12. Thus let them from that 
time forth labor diligently until 
it shall be finished, from the cor- 
ner stone thereof unto the top 
thereof, until there shall not any- 
thing remain that is not finished. 

13. Verily I say unto you, let 
not my servant Joseph, neither 
my servant Sidney, neither my 
servant Hyrum, get in debt any 
more for the building of a house 
unto my name; 

14. But let a house be built 
unto my name according to the 
"pattern which I will show unto 
them. 

15. And if my people build it 
not according to the pattern

I shall show unto their presi-

accept it at the hands of my peo- 
ple.

unto you, it is my will that the

up speedily by the gathering of 
my saints; 

18. And also that other places 
should be appointed for stakes in 
the regions round about, as they 
shall be manifested unto my ser-

him, and I will sanctify him be-

have I given the *keys of this 
kingdom and ministry. Even so. 
Amen.

Missouri, July 8, 1838, concerning the immediate duties of certain

1. Verily thus saith the Lord

their business speedily and jour- 
ney from the land of Kirtland, 
before I, the Lord, send again the

2. Let them awake, and arise, 
and come forth, and not tarry,

3. Therefore, if they tarry it 
shall not be well with them. 

4. Let them repent of all their 
sins, and of all their covetous de- 
sires, before me, saith the Lord; 



for what is property unto me? 
saith the Lord. 

5. Let the properties of Kirt- 
land be turned out for debts, 
saith the Lord. Let them go, 
saith the Lord, and whatsoever 
remaineth, let it remain in your 
hands, saith the Lord. 

6. For have I not the fowls of 
heaven, and also the fish of the 
sea, and the beasts of the moun-

8. Is there not room enough 
on the "mountains of Adam-ondi- 
Ahman, and on the plains of 
Olaha Shinehah, or the land, 
where Adam dwelt, that you 
should covet that which is but the 
drop, and neglect the more 
weighty matters? 

9. Therefore, come up hither 
unto the land of my people, even 
Zion. 

10. Let my servant William 
Marks be faithful over a few 
things, and he shall be a ruler 
over many. Let him preside in 
the midst of my people in the 
city of Far West, and let him be 
blessed with the blessings of my 
people. 

11. Let my servant Newel K. 
Whitney be ashamed of the c Nico- 
laitane band and of all their 
secret abominations, and of all 
his littleness of soul before me, 
saith the Lord, and come up to 
the land of d Adam-ondi-Ahman, 
and be a bishop unto my people, 
saith the Lord, not in name but 
In deed, saith the Lord. 

12. And again, I say unto you, 



I remember my servant Oliver 
Granger; behold, verily I say unto 
him that his name shall be had 
in sacred remembrance from gen- 
eration to generation, forever and 
ever, saith the Lord. 

13. Therefore, let him con- 
tend earnestly for the redemption 
of the First Presidency of my 
Church, saith the Lord; and when 
he falls he shall rise again, for 
his sacrifice shall be more sacred 
unto me than his increase, saith 
the Lord. 

14. Therefore, let him come 
up hither speedily, unto the land 
of Zion; and in the due time he 
shall be made a merchant unto 
my name, saith the Lord, for the 
benefit of my people. 

15. Therefore let no man de- 
spise my servant Oliver Granger, 
but let the blessings of my people 
be on him forever and ever. 

16/ And again, verily I say unto 
you, let all my servants in the 
land of Kirtland remember the 
Lord their God, and mine house 
also, to keep and preserve it holy, 
and to overthrow the money- 
changers in mine own due time, 
saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.

Missouri, July 8, 1838, in answer to the supplication : Lord, shot

1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, 



I require °all their surplus prop-

the bishop of my church in Zion, 

2. For the building of mine 
house, and for the laying of the 
foundation of Zion and for the

have thus been tithed shall pay 
c one-tenth of all their interest 
annually; and this shall be a

Lord. 



5. Verily I say unto you, it 
shall come to pass that all those 
who gather unto the land of Zion 
shall be tithed of their 'surplus 
properties, and shall observe this 
law, or they shall not be found 
worthy to abide among you. 

6. And I say unto you, if my 
people observe not this law, to 
keep it holy, and by this law 
sanctify the land of Zion unto 
me, that my statutes and my 
judgments may be kept thereon, 
that it may be most holy, behold, 
verily I say unto you, it shall not 
be a land of Zion unto you.

Even so. Amen.

Prayer and Prophecies, written by Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri, dated March 20, 1839. 
The Prophet with several companions had been months in prison. 
Their petitions and appeals directed to the executive officers and the 
judiciary had failed to bring them relief. See History of the Church, 

vol. 3, p. 289. Fervent appeals to the Lord in behalf of the suffer- 

ing Saints — The curse of the Lord to fall upon those who contend 
against his will — Men though called may not be chosen — The rights of

righteous exercise of the powers of the Priesthood leads to apostasy — 
Powers of the Priesthood to be exercised in justice and mercy. 



1. O God, where art thou? 
And where is the pavilion that 
covereth thy "hiding place? 

2. How long shall thy hand be 
stayed, and thine eye, yea thy 
pure eye, behold from the eternal 
heavens the wrongs of thy peo- 
ple and of thy servants, and thine 
ear be penetrated with their 
cries? 

3. Yea, O Lord, how long shall 
they suffer these wrongs and un- 
lawful oppressions, before thine 
heart shall be softened toward 
them, and thy bowels be moved 
with compassion toward them? 

4. O Lord God Almighty, maker 
of heaven, earth, and seas, and 
of all things that in them are, 
and who controllest and subject- 
est the devil, and the dark and 
benighted dominion of Sheol — 
stretch forth thy hand; let thine 
eye pierce; let thy pavilion be 
taken up; let thy 6 hiding place 
no longer be covered; let thine 
ear be inclined; let thine heart 
be softened, and thy bowels 



moved with compassion toward 
us. 

5. Let thine anger be kindled 
against our enemies; and, in the 
fury of thine heart, with thy 
c sword avenge us of our wrongs. 

6. Remember thy suffering 
saints, O our God; and thy ser- 
vants will rejoice in thy name 
forever. 

7. My son, peace be unto thy 
soul; thine adversity and thine 
afflictions shall be but a small 
moment; 

8. And then, if thou endure it 
well, God shall exalt thee on 
high; thou shalt triumph over all 
thy foes. 

9. Thy friends do stand by 
thee, and they shall hail thee 
again with warm hearts and 
friendly hands.

thy friends do not contend against 
thee, neither charge thee with 
transgression, as they did Job.

hope shall be blasted, and their 
prospects shall melt away as the 
hoar frost melteth before the 
burning rays of the rising sun; 

12. And also that God hath set 
his hand and seal to change the 
times and seasons, and to blind 
their minds, that they may not 
understand d his marvelous work- 
ings; that he may prove them 
also and take them in their own 
craftiness; 

13. Also because their hearts 
are corrupted, and the things 
which they are willing to bring 
upon others, and love to have 
others suffer, may come upon 
themselves to the very uttermost; 

14. That they may be disap- 
pointed also, and their hopes may 
be cut off; 

15. And not many years hence, 
that they and their posterity shall 
be "swept from under heaven, 
saith God, that not one of them 
is left to stand by the wall. 

16. Cursed are all those that 
shall lift up the heel against 
'mine anointed, saith the Lord, 
and cry they have sinned when 
they have not sinned before me, 
saith the Lord, but have done 
that which was meet in mine 
eyes, and which I commanded 
them. 

17. But those who cry trans- 
gression do it because they are 
the servants of sin, and are the 
children of disobedience them- 
selves. 

18. And those who swear false- 
ly against my servants, that they 
might bring them into bondage 
and death — 

19. Wo unto them; because 
they have offended my little ones 
they shall be severed from the 
ordinances of mine house. 

20. Their basket shall not be 



full, their houses and their barns 
shall perish, and they themselves 
shall be despised by those that 
flattered them. 

21. They shall not have right 
to the priesthood, nor their pos- 
terity after them from genera- 
tion to generation. 

22. It had been better for 
them that a millstone had been 
hanged about their necks, and 
they drowned in the depth of the 
sea. 

23. Wo unto all those that dis- 
comfort my people, and drive, 
and murder, and testify against 
them, saith the Lord of Hosts; 
a generation of vipers shall not 
escape the damnation of hell. 

24. Behold, mine eyes see and 
know all their works, and I have 
in reserve a swift judgment in 
the season thereof, for them all; 

25. For there is a time ap- 
pointed for every man, accord- 
ing as his works shall be. 

26. God shall give unto you 
"knowledge by his Holy Spirit, 
yea, by the unspeakable gift of 
the Holy Ghost, that has not been 
revealed since the world was until 
now; 

27. Which our forefathers 
have awaited with anxious expec- 
tation to be revealed in the last 
times, which their minds were 
pointed to by the angels, as *held 
in reserve for the fulness of their 
glory; 

28. A time to come in the 
which nothing shall be withheld, 
whether there be one God or 
'many gods, they shall be mani- 
fest. 

29. All thrones and dominions, 
principalities and powers, shall 
be revealed and set forth upon 
'all who have endured valiantly 
for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

months, and years, and alt the 
days of their days, months, and 
years, and all their glories, laws, 
and set times, shall be revealed 
in the days of the 'dispensation

32. According to that which 
was ordained in the midst of the 
Council of the Eternal God of all 
other gods before this world was, 
that should be 'reserved unto

When every man shall enter into

Immortal rest.

ters remain impure? What power

might man stretch forth his puny 
arm to stop the Missouri river 
in its decreed course, or to turn 
it up stream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from "pouring down 
knowledge from heaven upon the 
heads of the Latter-day Saints. 

34. Behold, there are many 
called, but "few are chosen. And 
why are they not chosen? 

35. Because their hearts are 
set so much upon the things of 
this world, and aspire to the 
honors of men, that they do not 
learn this one lesson — 

36. That the rights of the 
priesthood are inseparably con- 
nected with the powers of heav- 
en, and that the powers of heaven 
'cannot be controlled nor handled 
only upon the principles of right- 
eousness. 

37. That they may be con- 
ferred upon us, it is true; but 
when we undertake to cover our 



sins, or to gratify our pride, our 
vain ambition, or to exercise con- 
trol or dominion or compulsion 
upon the souls of the children 
of men, in any degree of un- 
righteousness, behold, the heav- 
ens withdraw themselves; the 
Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and 
when it Is withdrawn, Amen to 
the priesthood or the authority 
of that man. 

38. Behold, ere he is aware, 
he is left unto himself, to kick 
againat the pricks, to persecute 
the saints, and to fight against 
God. 

39. We have learned by sad 
experience that it is the nature 
and disposition of almost all men, 
as soon as they get a little au- 
thority, as they suppose, they will 
immediately begin to exercise 
'unrighteous dominion. 

40. Hence many are called, hut 
'few are chosen. 

41. No power or influence can 
or ought to be maintained by vir- 
tue of the priesthood, only by 
persuasion, by long-suffering, by 
gentleness and meekness, and by 
love unfeigned; 

42. By kindness, and pure 
knowledge, which shall greatly 
enlarge the soul without hypoc- 
risy, and without guile — 

43. Reproving betimes with 
sharpness, when moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost; and then show- 
ing forth afterwards an increase 
of love toward him whom thou 
hast reproved, lest he esteem 
thee to be his enemy; 

44. That he may know that 
thy faithfulness is stronger than 
the cords of death.

of charity towards all men. and

let virtue garnish thy thoughts 
unceasingly; then shall thy con- 
fidence wax strong in the pres- 
ence of God; and the doctrine of 
the priesthood shall distil upon 
thy soul as the dews from heaven.

thy constant companion, and thy 
scepter an unchanging scepter of 
righteousness and truth; and thy 
dominion shall be an everlasting 
dominion, and without compul- 
sory means it shall flow unto thee

shall cast thee into trouble, and 
into bars and walls, thou shalt 
be had in honor; and but for a 
small moment and thy voice shall 
be more terrible in the midst of 
thine enemies than the fierce lion, 
because of thy righteousness; and 
thy God shall stand by thee for- 
ever and ever.

manner of false accusations; if 
thine enemies fall upon thee; if 
they tear thee from the society 
of thy father and mother and 



brethren and sisters; and if with 
a drawn sword thine enemies tear 
thee from the bosom of thy wife, 
and of thine offspring, and thine 
elder son, although but six years 
of age, shall cling to thy gar- 
ments, and shall say, My father, 
my father, why can't you stay 
with us? O, my father, what are 
the men going to do with you? 
and if then he shall be thrust 
from thee by the sword, and thou 
be dragged to prison, and thine 
enemies prowl around thee like 
wolves for the blood of the 
lamb; 

7. And if thou shouldst be cast 
into the pit, or into the hands of 
murderers, and the sentence of 
death passed upon thee; if thou 
be cast into the deep; if the bil- 
lowing surge conspire against 
thee ; if fierce winds become thine 
enemy; if the heavens gather 
blackness, and all the elements 
combine to hedge up the way; 
and above all, if the very jaws 
of hell shall gape open the mouth 
wide after thee, know thou, my 
son, that all these things shall 
give thee experience, and shall be 
for thy good.

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, 
January 19, 1841. Because of increasing persecutions and illegal pro- 
cedures against them by public officers, the Saints had been compelled 
to leave Missouri. The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. 
Boggs, Governor of Missouri, dated October 27, 1838, had left them 
no alternative. See History of the Church, vol. 3, p. 175. In 1841, 
when this revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site 
of the former village of Commerce, Illinois, had been built up by the 
Saints, and here the headquarters of the Church had been estab- 
lished. Proclamation to the president of the United States, the

1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, my servant Joseph 
Smith, I am well pleased with 
your offering and acknowledg- 
ments, which you have made; for 
unto this end have I raised you 
up, that I might show forth my 
wisdom through the "weak things 
of the earth. 

2. Your prayers are acceptable 
before me; and in answer to them 
I say unto you, that you are now 
called immediately to make a 
^solemn proclamation of my gos- 
pel, and of this c stake which I 
have planted to be a corner-stone 
of Zion, which shall be polished 
with the refinement which is after 
the similitude of a palace. 

3. This proclamation shall be 
made to all the kings of the world, 
to the four corners thereof, to 
the honorable president-elect, and 
the high-minded governors of the 
nation in which you live, and to 
all the nations of the earth scat- 
tered abroad. 

4. Let it be written in the spirit 
of meekness and by the power of 
the Holy Ghost, which shall be in 
you at the time of the writing of 
the same; 

5. For it shall be d given you by 
the Holy Ghost to know my will 
concerning those kings and au- 
thorities, even what shall befall 
them in a time to come. 

6. For, behold, I am about to 
call upon them to give heed to 
the light and glory of Zion, for 



the set time has come to favor 
her. 

7. Call ye, therefore, upon 
them with loud proclamation, and 
with your testimony, fearing them 
not, for they are as grass, and all 
their glory as the flower thereof 
which soon falleth, that they may 
be left also without excuse — 

8. And that I may visit them 
in the day of visitation, when I 
shall e unveil the face of my cover- 
ing, to appoint the portion of 
the oppressor among hypocrites, 
where there is gnashing of teeth, 
if they reject my servants and 
my testimony which I have re- 
vealed unto them. 

9. And again, I will visit and 
soften their hearts, many of them 
for your good, that ye may find 
grace in their eyes, that they may 
'come to the light of truth, and 
the Gentiles to the exaltation or 
lifting up of Zion. 

10. For the day of my visita- 
tion cometh speedily, in an hour 
when ye think not of; and where 
shall be the safety of my people, 
and refuge for those who shall 
be left of them? 

11. Awake, O kings of the 
earth! Come ye, O, come ye, with 
your gold and your silver, to the 
help of my people, to the house 
of the daughters of Zion. 

12. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let my servant Robert 
B. Thompson help you to write 
this proclamation, for I am well

pleased with him, and that he 
should be with you; 

13. Let him, therefore, heark- 
en to your counsel, and I will 
bless him with a multiplicity of 
blessings; let him be faithful and 
true in all things from hence- 
forth, and he shall be great in 
mine eyes; 

14. But let him remember that 
his "stewardship will I require at 
his hands. 

15. And again, verily I say 
unto you, blessed is my servant 
Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, 
love him because of the integrity 
of his heart, and because he lov- 
eth that which is right before me, 
saith the Lord. 

16. Again, let my servant John 
C. Bennett help you in your labor 
in sending my word to the kings 
and people of the earth, and stand 
by you, even you my servant Jo- 
seph Smith, in the hour of afflic- 
tion; and his reward shall not 
fail if he receive counsel. 

17. And for his love he shall 
be great, for he shall be mine if 
he do this, saith the Lord. I 
have seen the work which he hath 
done, which I accept if he con- 
tinue, and will crown him with 
blessings and great glory. 

18. And again, I say unto you 
that it is my will that my ser- 
vant Lyman Wight should con- 
tinue in preaching for Zion, in 
the spirit of meekness, confess- 
ing me before the world; and I 
will bear him up as on eagles' 
wings; and he shall beget glory 
and honor to himself and unto 
my name. 

19. That when he shall finish 
his work I may receive him unto 
myself, even as I did my servant 
David Patten, who is with me at 
this time, and also my servant 
Edward Partridge, and also my 



aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen., 
who sitteth with Abraham at his 
right hand, and blessed and holy 
is he, for he is mine. 

20. And again, verily I say 
unto you, my servant George Mil- 
ler is without guile; he may be 
trusted because of the integrity 
of his heart; and for the love 
which he has to my testimony I, 
the Lord, love him. 

21. I therefore say unto you, 
I seal upon his head the office of 
a bishopric, like unto my servant 
Edward Partridge, that he may 
receive the consecrations of mine 
house, that he may administer 
blessings upon the heads of the 
poor of my people, saith the Lord. 
Let no man despise my servant 
George, for he shall honor me. 

22. Let my servant George, 
and my servant Lyman, and my 
servant John Snider, and others, 
build a "house unto my name, 
such a one as my servant Joseph 
shall show unto them, upon the 
place which he shall show unto 
them also. 

23. And it shall be for a house 
for boarding, a house that stran- 
gers may come from afar to lodge 
therein ; therefore let it be a good 
house, worthy of all acceptation, 
that the weary traveler may find 
health and safety while he shall 
contemplate the word of the Lord, 
and the corner-stone I have ap- 
pointed for Zion. 

24. This house shall be a 
healthful habitation if it be built 
unto my name, and if the gover- 
nor which shall be appointed 
unto it shall not suffer any pollu- 
tion to come upon it. It shall be 
holy, or the Lord your God will 
not dwell therein. 

25. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let *all my saints come 
from afar.

26. And send ye swift messen- 
gers, yea, chosen messengers, 
and say unto them: Come ye, 
with all your gold, and your sil- 
ver, and your precious stones, and 
with all your antiquities; and 
with all who have knowledge of 
antiquities, that will come, may

per, and with brass, and with 
xinc, and with all your precious 
things of the earth; and build a 
house to my name, for the 'Most 
High to dwell therein. 

28. For there la not a place 
found on earth that he may come 
to and restore again that which 
'was lost unto you, or which he 
hath taken away, even the fulness 
of the priesthood. 

29. For a 'baptismal font there 
ts not upon the earth, that they, 
my saints, may be 'baptized for 
those who are dead — 

30. For this ordinance belong- 
eth to my house, and cannot be 
acceptable to me, only In the days 
of yonr poverty, wherein ye are 
not able to build a house unto 

31. But I command you, all ye 
my saints, to build a house unto 
me; and I grant unto you a suffi- 
cient time to build a house unto 
me; and during this time your 
'baptisms shall be acceptable 
unto me. 

32. But behold, at the end ol 
this appointment your "baptisms 
for your dead shall not be ac- 
ceptable unto me; and if you do 
not these things at the end of the 
appointment ye shall be "rejected 



a church, with your dead, saith 
the Lord your God. 

33. For verily I say unto you, 
that after you have had sufficient 
time to build a house to me, 
wherein the ordinance of 'baptiz- 
ing for the dead belongeth, and 
for which the same was instituted • 
from before the foundation of the 
world, 'your baptisms for your 
dead cannot be acceptable unto 

34. For therein are the keys 
of the holy priesthood ordained, 
that you may receive honor and 
glory. 

35. And 'after this time, your 
baptisms for the dead, by those 
who are scattered abroad, are not 
acceptable unto me, saith the 

36. For it is ordained that in 
Zlon, and in her stakes, and in 
Jerusalem, those places which 1 
have appointed for refuge, shall 
be the 'places for your baptisms 
for your dead. 

37. And again, verily I say 
unto you, how shall your 'wash- 
ings be acceptable unto me, ex- 
cept ye perform them in a house 
which you have built to my name? 

38. For, for this cause 1 "com- 
manded Moses that he should 
build a tabernacle, that they 
should bear it with them in the 
wilderness, and to build a house 
in the land, of promise, that those 
ordinances might be revealed 
which had been hid from before 
the world was. 

39. Therefore, verily I say unto 
you, that your 'anointings, and 
your washings, and your baptisms 
for the dead, and your solemn 
assemblies, and your memorials 
for your sacrifices by the sons of 
Levi, and for your oracles In your

most holy places wherein you re- 
ceive conversations, and your 
statutes and judgments, for the 
beginning of the revelations and 
foundation of Zion, and for the 
glory, honor, and endowment, of 
all her municipals, are ordained 
by the ordinance of my holy 
house, which my people are "al- 
ways commanded to build unto 
my holy name. 

40. And verily I say unto you, 
let this house be built unto my 
name, that I 'may reveal mine 
ordinances therein unto my peo- 
ple; 

41. For I deign to reveal unto 
my church things which have 
been kept hid from before the 
foundation of the world, things 
that pertain to the "dispensation 
of the fulness of times. 

42. And I will show unto my 
servant Joseph all things pertain- 
ing to this house, and the priest- 
hood thereof, and the place 
whereon it shall be built. 

43. And ye shall build it on 
the place where you have contem- 
plated building it, for that is the 
spot which I have chosen for you 
to build it. 

44. If ye labor with all your 
might, I will consecrate that spot 
that it shall be made holy. 

45. And if my people will 
hearken unto my voice, and unto 
the voice of my servants whom I 
have appointed to lead my peo- 
ple, behold, verily I say unto you, 
they shall not be moved out of 
their place. 

4 6. But if they will not hearken 
to my voice, nor unto the voice 
of these men whom I have ap- 
pointed, they shall not be blest, 
because they pollute mine holy 
grounds, and mine holy ordi- 
nances, and charters, and my holy 
words which I give unto them. 



47. And it shall come to pass 
that if you build a house unto 
my name, and do not do the 
things that I say, I will not per- 
form the oath which I make unto 
you, neither fulfil the promises 
which ye expect at my hands, 
saith the Lord. 

48. For instead of blessings, 
ye, by your own works, bring 
cursings, wrath, indignation, and 
judgments upon your own heads, 
by your follies, and by all your 
abominations, which you practise 
before me, saith the Lord. 

49. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, that when I give a command- 
ment to any of the sons of men 
to do a work unto my name, and 
those sons of men go with all 
their might and with all they 
have to perform that work, and 
cease not their diligence, and 
their enemies come upon them 
and hinder them from perform- 
ing that work, behold, it behoov- 
eth me to require that work no 
more at the hands of those sons 
of men, but to accept of their 
offerings. 

50. And the iniquity and trans- 
gression of my holy laws and com- 
mandments I will visit upon the 
heads of those who hindered my 
work, unto the third and fourth 
generation, so long as they re- 
pent not, and hate me, saith the 
Lord God. 

51. Therefore, for this cause 
'have I accepted the offerings of 
those whom I commanded to 
build up a city and a house unto 
my name, in Jackson county, Mis- 
souri, and were hindered by their 
enemies, saith the Lord your God. 

52. And I will * a answer judg-

era t ion, so long as they repent 
not, and hate me, saith the Lord 
your God. 

53. And this I make an ex- 
ample unto you, for your consola- 
tion concerning all those who 
have been commanded to do a 
work and have been "hindered 
by the hands of their enemies, 
and by oppression, saith the Lord 
your God. 

64. For I am the Lord your 
God, and will save all those of 
your brethren who have been pure 
in heart, and have been slain in 
the land of Missouri, saith the 
Lord. 

65. And again, verily I say 
unto you, I command you again 
to build a house to my name, even 
in this place, that you may 2c prove 
yourselves unto me that ye are 
faithful in all things whatsoever 
I command you, that I may bless 
you, and crown you with honor, 
immortality, and eternal life. 

56. And now I say unto you, 
as pertaining to my boarding 
house which I have commanded 
you to build for the boarding of 
strangers, let it be built unto my 
name, and let my name be named 
upon it, and let my servant Jo- 
seph and his house have place 
therein, from generation to gen- 
eration. 

6.7. For this "anointing have 
I put upon his head, that his 
blessing shall also be put upon 
the head of his posterity after 
him. 

58. And as I said unto Abra- 
ham concerning the kindreds of 
the earth, even so I say unto my 
servant Joseph: In thee and in 
* e thy seed shall the kindred of the 
earth be blessed. 

59. Therefore, let my servant 
Joseph and his seed after him 
have place in that house, from 



generation to generation, forever 
and ever, saith the Lord. 

60. And let the name of that 
house be called Nauvoo House; 
and let it be a delightful habita- 
tion for man, and a resting-place 
for the 2 'weary traveler, that he 
may contemplate the glory of 
Zion, and the glory of this, the 
corner-stone thereof; 

61. That he may receive also 
the counsel from those whom I 
have set to be as plants of re- 
nown, and as watchmen upon her 
walls. 

62. Behold, verily I say unto 
you, let my servant George Mil- 
ler, and my servant Lyman 
Wight, and my servant John Sni- 
der, and my servant Peter Haws, 
organize themselves, and appoint 
one of them to be a president 
over their quorum for the pur- 
pose of building that house. 

63. And they shall form a con- 
stitution, whereby they may re- 
ceive stock for the building of 
that house. 

64. And they shall not receive 
less than fifty dollars for a share 
of stock in that house, and they 
shall be permitted to receive fif- 
teen thousand dollars from any 
one man for stock in that house. 

65. But they shall not be per- 
mitted to receive over fifteen 
thousand dollars stock from any 
one man. 

66. And they shall not be per- 
mitted to receive under fifty dol- 
lars for a share of stock from 
any one man in that house. 

67. And they shall not be per- 
mitted to receive any man, as a 
stockholder in this house, except 
the same shall pay his stock into 
their hands at the time he re- 
ceives stock;

their hands he shall receive stock 
in that house; but if he pays 
nothing into their hands he shall 
not receive any stock in that 
house. 

69. And if any pay stock into 
their hands it shall be for stock 
in that house, for himself, and 
for his generation after him, from 
generation to generation, so long 
as he and his heirs shall hold that 
stock, and do not sell or convey 
the stock away out of their hands 
by their own free will and act, if 
you will do my will, saith the 
Lord your God.

Miller, and my servant Lyman 
Wight, and my servant John Sni- 
der, and my servant Peter Haws, 
receive any stock into their hands, 
in moneys, or in properties where- 
in they receive the real value of 
moneys, they shall not appro- 
priate any portion of that stock 
to any other purpose, only in 
that house. 

71. And if they do appropriate 
any portion of that stock any- 
where else, only in that house, 
without the consent of the stock- 
holder, and do not repay four- 
fold for the stock which they ap- 
propriate anywhere else, only in 
that house, they shall be ac- 
cursed, and shall be moved out 
of their place, saith the Lord God; 
for I, the Lord, am God, and can- 
not be mocked in any of these 
things. 

72. Verily I say unto you, let 
my servant Joseph pay stock into 
their hands for the building of 
that house, as seemeth him good ; 
but my servant Joseph cannot 
pay over fifteen thousand dollars 
stock in that house, nor under 
fifty dollars; neither can any 
other man, saith the Lord. 

73. And there are others also 



who wish to know my will con- 
cerning them, for they have asked 
it at my hands. 

74. Therefore, I say unto you 
concerning my servant Vinson 
Knight, if he will do my will let 
him put stock into that house for 
himself, and for his generation 
after him, from generation to 
generation. 

75. And let him lift up his 
voice long and loud, in the midst 
of the people, to plead the cause 
of the poor and the needy; and 
let him not fail, neither let his 
heart faint; and I will accept of 
his offerings, for they shall not 
be unto me as the offerings of 
Cain, for he shall be mine, saith 
the Lord. 

76. Let his family rejoice and 
turn away their hearts from afflic- 
tion; for I have chosen him and 
anointed him, and he shall be 
honored in the midst of his house, 
for I will forgive all his sins, 
saith the Lord. Amen. 

77. Verily I say unto you, let 
my servant Hyrum put stock into 
that house as seemeth him good, 
for himself and his generation 
after him, from generation to 
generation. 

78. Let my servant Isaac Gal- 
land put stock into that house; 
for I, the Lord, love him for the 
work he hath done, and will for- 
give all his sins; therefore, let 
him be remembered for an in- 
terest in that house from gen- 
eration to generation. 

79. Let my servant Isaac Gal- 
land be appointed among you, 
and be ordained by my servant 
William Marks, and be blessed 
of him, to go with my servant 
Hyrum to accomplish the work 
that my servant Joseph shall 
point out to them, and they shall 
be greatly blessed. 

80. Let my servant William

Marks pay stock into that house, 
as seemeth him good, for him- 
self and his generation, from gen- 
eration to generation. 

81. Let my servant Henry 6. 
Sherwood pay stock into that 
house, as seemeth him good, for 
himself and his seed after him, 
from generation to generation. 

82. Let my servant William 
Law pay stock into that house, 
for himself and his seed after 
him, from generation to genera- 
tion. 

83. If he will do my will let 
him not take his family unto the 
eastern lands, even unto Kirt- 
land; nevertheless, I, the Lord, 
will build up Kirtland, but I, the 
Lord, have a scourge prepared 
for the inhabitants thereof. 

84. And with my servant Al- 
mon Babbitt, there are many 
things with which I am not 
pleased; behold, he aspireth to 
establish his counsel instead of 
the counsel which I have or- 
dained, even that of the Presi- 
dency of my Church; and he set- 
teth up a golden calf for the wor- 
ship of my people. 

85. Let no man go from this 
place who has come here essay- 
ing to keep my commandments. 

86. If they ^live here let them 
live unto me; and if they die let 
them die unto me; for they shall 
rest from all their labors here, 
and shall continue their works. 

87. Therefore, let my servant 
William put his trust in me, and 
cease to fear concerning his fam- 
ily, because of the sickness of the 
land. If ye love me, keep my 
commandments; and the sickness 
of the land shall redound to your 
glory. 

88. Let my servant William go 
and proclaim 2 *my everlasting 



gospel with a loud voice, and with 
great joy, as he shall be moved 
upon by my Spirit, unto the in- 
habitants of Warsaw, and also 
unto the inhabitants of Carthage, 
and also unto the inhabitants of 
Burlington, and also unto the in- 
habitants of Madison, and await 
patiently and diligently for fur- 
ther instructions at my general 
conference, saith the Lord. 

89. If he will do my will let 
him from henceforth hearken to 
the counsel of my servant Joseph, 
and with his interest support the 
cause of the poor, and 2i publish 
the new translation of my holy 
word unto the inhabitants of the 
earth 

90.' And if he will do this I 
will bless him with a multiplicity 
of blessings, that he shall not be 
forsaken, nor his seed be found 
begging bread. 

91. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let my servant Wil- 
liam be appointed, ordained, and 
anointed, as a counselor unto my 
servant Joseph, in the room of 
my servant Hyrum, that my ser- 
vant Hyrum may take the office 
of Priesthood and 2 &gt;Patriarch, 
which was appointed unto him by 
his father, by blessing and also 
by right; 

92. That from henceforth 2 *he 
shall hold the keys of the patri- 
archal blessings upon the heads 
of all my people, 

93. That 2l whoever he blesses 
shall be blessed, and whoever he 
2m curses shall be cursed; that 
whatsoever he shall bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven; and 
whatsoever he shall loose on earth 
shall be loosed in heaven. 

94. And from this time forth 
I 2n appoint unto him that he may 
be a prophet, and a seer, and a

revelator unto my church, as well 
as my servant Joseph; 

95. That he may act in con- 
cert also with my servant Joseph; 
and that he shall receive counsel 
from my servant Joseph, who 
shall show unto him the 2o keys 
whereby he may ask and receive, 
and be crowned with the same 
blessing, and glory, and honor, 
and priesthood, and gifts of the 
priesthood, that once were put 
upon him that was my servant 
Oliver Cowdery; 

96. That my servant Hyrum 
may bear record of the things 
which I shall show unto him, that 
his name may be had in honorable 
remembrance from generation to 
generation, forever and ever. 

97. Let my servant William 
Law also receive 2p the keys by 
which he may ask and receive 
blessings; let him be humble be- 
fore me, and be without guile, 
and he shall receive of my Spirit, 
even the 2 «Comforter, which shall 
manifest unto him the truth of 
all things, and shall give him, in 
the very hour, what he shall 
say. 

98. And these signs shall fol- 
low him — he shall heal the sick, 
he shall cast out devils, and shall 
be delivered from those who 
would administer unto him dead- 
ly poison; 

99. And he shall be led in 
paths where the poisonous ser- 
pent cannot lay hold upon his 
heel, and he shall mount up in 
the imagination of his thoughts 
as upon eagles' wings. 

100. And what if I will that 
he should raise the dead, let him 
not withhold his voice. 

101. Therefore, let my servant 
William cry aloud and spare not, 
with joy and rejoicing, and with 
hosannas to him that sitteth upon 



the throne forever and ever, saith 
the Lord your God. 

102. Behold, I say unto you, I 
have a mission in store for my 
servant William, and my servant 
Hyrum, and for them alone; and 
let my servant Joseph tarry at 
home, for he is needed. The re- 
mainder I will show unto you 
hereafter. Even so. Amen. 

103. And again, verily I say 
unto you, if my servant Sidney 
will serve me and be counselor 
unto my servant Joseph, let him 
arise and come up and stand in 
the office of his calling, and hum- 
ble himself before me. 

104. And if he will offer unto 
me an acceptable offering, and ac- 
knowledgments, and remain with 
my people, behold, I, the Lord 
your God, will heal him that he 
shall be healed; and he shall lift 
up his voice again on the moun- 
tains, and be a 2r spokesman be- 
fore my face. 

105. Let him come and locate 
his family in the neighborhood 
in which my servant Joseph re- 
sides. 

106. And in all his journey- 
ings let him lift up his voice as 
with the sound of a trump, and 
warn the inhabitants of the earth 
to flee the wrath to come. 

107. Let him assist my servant 
Joseph, and also let my servant 
William Law assist my servant 
Joseph, in making a ''solemn 
proclamation unto the kings of 
the earth, even as I have before 
said unto you. 

108. If my servant Sidney will 
do my will, let him not remove 
his family unto the eastern lands, 
but let him change their habita- 
tion, even as I have said. 

109. Behold, it is not my will

111. And again, verily I say 
Linto you, let my servant Amos 
Davies pay stock into the hands 
Df those whom I have appointed 
bo build a house for boarding, 
Bven the Nauvoo House. 

112. This let him do if he will 
have an interest; and let him 
hearken unto the counsel of my 
servant Joseph, and labor with 
his own hands that he may ob- 
tain the confidence of men. 

113. And when he shall prove 
himself faithful in all things that 
shall be entrusted unto his care, 
yea, even a few things, he shall 
he made ruler over many; 

114. Let him therefore abase 
himself that he may be exalted. 
Even so. Amen. 

115. And again, verily I say 
unto you, if my servant Robert 
D. Foster will obey my voice, let 
liim build a house for my servant 
Joseph, according to the contract 
"which he has made with him, as 
the door shall be open to him 
from time to time. 

116. And let him repent of all 
lis folly, and clothe himself with 
charity; and cease to do evil, and 
lay aside all his hard speeches; 

117. And pay stock also into 
the hands of the quorum of the 
Nauvoo House, for himself and 
lor his generation after him, from 
generation to generation; 

118. And hearken unto the 
counsel of my servants Joseph, 
and Hyrum, and William Law, 
and unto the authorities which I 
have called to lay the foundation 
of Zion; and it shall be well with 



him forever and ever. Even so. 
Amen. 

119. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let no man pay stock 
to the quorum of the Nauvoo 
House unless he shall be a be- 
liever in the Book of Mormon, 
and the revelations I have given 
unto you, saith the Lord your 
God; 

120. For that which is more or 
less than this cometh of evil, and 
shall be attended with cursings 
and not blessings, saith the Lord 
your God. Even so. Amen. 

121. And again, verily I say 
unto you, let the quorum of the 
Nauvoo House have a just recom- 
pense of wages for all their labors 
which they do in building the 
Nauvoo House; and let their 
wages be as shall be agreed 
among themselves, as pertaining 
to the price thereof. 

122. And let every man who 
pays stock bear his proportion of 
their wages, if it must needs be, 
for their support, saith the Lord; 
otherwise, their labors shall be 
accounted unto them for stock in 
that house. Even so. Amen. 

123. Verily I say unto you, I 
now give unto you 2 'the officers 
belonging to my Priesthood, that 
ye may hold the keys thereof, 
even the Priesthood which is after 
the order of Melchizedek, which 
is after the order of mine Only 
Begotten Son. 

124. First, I give unto you Hy- 
rum Smith to be a 2u patriarch 
unto you, to hold the sealing 
blessings of my church, even the 
Holy Spirit of promise, whereby 
ye are sealed up unto the day of 
redemption, that ye may not fall 
notwithstanding the hour of

you.

I give unto you a 2 *high council, 
for the corner-stone of Zion — 

132. Namely, Samuel Bent, 
Henry G. Sherwood, George W. 
Harris, Charles C. Rich, Thomas 
Grover, Newel Knight, David

in his stead; and verily I say 
unto you, let my servant Aaron 
Johnson be ordained unto this 



calling in his stead — David Full- 
mer, Alpheus Cutler, William j I

saith the Lord unto you : My ser- 
vant Brigham, it is no more re- 
quired at your hand to leave your 
family as in times past, for your 
offering is acceptable to me. 



2. I have seen your labor and

SECTION 127. 



An Epistle from Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Latter-day 
Saints at Nauvoo, Illinois, containing directions on baptism for the 

dead; dated at Nauvoo, September 1, 1842. Because of intense 

persecution and consequent interference with his labors, the Prophet 
purposes to go into retirement for a short period — He rejoices in the 
eventual triumph of the cause of God — He gives the word of the Lord 
respecting the records to be made of baptisms for the dead. 



1. Forasmuch as the Lord has 
revealed unto me that my en- 
emies, both in Missouri and this 
State, were again in the pursuit 
of me; and inasmuch as they pur- 
sue me without a cause, and have 
not the least shadow or coloring 
of justice or right on their side 
in the getting up of their prose- 
cutions against me; and inasmuch 
as their pretensions are all found- 
ed in falsehood of the # blackest 
dye, I have thought it expedient 
and wisdom in me to leave the 
place for a short season, for my 
own safety and the safety of this 
people. I would say to all those 
with whom I have business, that 
I have left my affairs with agents 
and clerks who will transact all 
business in a prompt and proper 
manner, and will see that all my 
debts are canceled in due time, 
by turning out property, or other- 
wise, as the case may require, or 
as the circumstances may admit 
of. When I learn that the storm 
is fully blown over, then I will 
return to you again. 

2. And as for the perils which 
I am called to pass through, they 



seem but a small thing to me, as 
the envy and wrath of man have 
been my common lot all the days 
of my life; and for what cause it 
seems mysterious, unless I was 
ordained from before the founda- 
tion of the world for some good 
end, or bad, as you may choose 
to call it. Judge ye for your- 
selves. God knoweth all these 
things, whether it be good or bad. 
But nevertheless, deep water is 
what I am wont to swim in. It 
all has become a second nature 
to me; and I feel, like Paul, to 
glory in tribulation; for to this 
day has the God of my fathers 
delivered me out of them all, and 
will deliver me from henceforth; 
for behold, and lo, I shall triumph 
over all my enemies, for the Lord 
God hath spoken it. 

3. Let all the saints rejoice, 
therefore, and be exceedingly 
glad; for Israel's God is their 
God, and he will mete out a just 
recompense of reward upon the 
heads of all their oppressors. 

4. And again, verily thus saith 
the Lord: Let the work of "my 
temple, and all the works which

mon — The voice of Michael, of Peter, James and John — Records of

1. As I stated to you in my 
letter before I left my place, that 
I would write to you from time 
to time and give you information 
in relation to many subjects, I 
now resume the subject of the 
"baptism for the dead, as that 
subject seems to occupy my mind, 
and press itself upon my feelings 
the strongest, since I have been 
pursued by my enemies. 

2. I wrote a few words of reve- 
lation to you concerning a re- 
corder. I have had a few addi- 
tional views in relation to this 
matter, which I now certify. That 
is, it was declared in my former 
letter that there should be a re- 
corder, who should be eye-wit- 
ness, and also to hear with his 
ears, that he might make a 
record of a truth before the 
Lord. 

3. Now, in relation to this mat- 
ter, it would be very difficult for 
one recorder to be present at all 
times, and to do all the business. 
To obviate this difficulty, there 
can be a recorder appointed in 
each ward of the city, who is well 
qualified for taking accurate min- 
utes; and let him be very partic- 
ular and precise in taking the 
whole proceedings, certifying in 
his record that he saw with his 
eyes, and heard with his ears, giv- 
ing the date, and names, and so 
forth, and the history of the whole 
transaction; naming also some 
three individuals that are pres- 
ent, if there be any present, who 
can at any time when called upon 
certify to the same, that in the 
6 mouth of two or three witnesses 
every word may be established. 

4. Then, let there be a gen- 



eral recorder, to whom these 
other records can be handed, jg 
being attended with certificates 
over their own signatures, cer- 
tifying that the record they ha?e 
made is true. Then the general 
church recorder can enter the ..] 
record on the general church 
book, with the certificates and all 
the attending witnesses, with his 
own statement that he verily be- 
lieves the above statement and 
records to be true, from his 
knowledge of the general char- 
acter and appointment of those 
men by the church. And when 
this is done on the general church 
book, the record shall be just as 
holy, and shall answer the ordi- 
nance just the same as if he had 
seen with his eyes and heard with 
his ears, and made a record of 
the same on the general church 
book. 

5. You may think this order of 
things to be very particular; but 
let me tell you that it is only to 
answer the will of God, by con- 
forming to the ordinance and 
preparation that the Lord or- 
dained and prepared e before the 
foundation of the world, for the 
salvation of the dead who should 
die without a knowledge of the 
gospel. 

6. And further, I want you to 
remember that John the Reve- 
lator was contemplating this very 
subject in relation to the dead, 
when he declared, as you will find 
recorded in Revelation 20:12 — 
And I saw the dead, small and 
great, stand before God; and the 
d books were opened; and another 

\book was opened, which is the book 
I of life ; and the dead were judged

233 



out of those things which were 
written in the books, according to 
their works. 

7. You will discover in this 
quotation that the books were 
opened; and another book was 
opened, which was the book of 
life; but the dead were judged 
out of those things which were 
written in the books, according 
to their works; consequently, the 
books spoken of must be the 
books which contained the record 
of their works, and refer to the 
•records which are kept on the 
earth. And the book which was 
the book of life is the record 
which is kept in heaven; the prin- 
ciple agreeing precisely with the 
doctrine which is commanded 
you in the revelation contained 
in the letter which I wrote to you 
previous to my leaving my place 
— that in all your recordings it 
may be 'recorded in heaven. 

8. Now, the nature of this or- 
dinance consists in the power of 
the priesthood, by the revelation 
of Jesus Christ, wherein it is 
granted that 'whatsoever you 
bind on earth shall be bound in 
heaven, and whatsoever you loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heav- 
en. Or, in other words, taking" a 
different view of the translation, 
whatsoever you *record on earth 
shall be recorded in heaven, and 
whatsoever you *do not record on 
earth shall not be recorded in 
heaven; for out of the books shall 
your dead be judged, according 
to their own works, whether they 
themselves have attended to the 
ordinances in their own propria 
persona, or by the means of their 
own agents, according to the or- 
dinance which God has prepared 
for their salvation from before 
the foundation of the world, ac- 



cording to the 'records which they 
have kept concerning their dead. 

9. It may seem to some to be 
a very bold doctrine that we talk 
of — a power which records or 
binds on earth and binds in heav- 
en. Nevertheless, in all ages of 
the world, whenever the Lord has 
given a dispensation of the priest- 
hood to any man by actual revela- 
tion, or any set of men, this 
power has always been given. 
Hence, whatsoever those men did 
in authority, in the name of the 
Lord, and did it truly and faith- 
fully, and kept a proper and 
*faithful record of the same, it 
became a law on earth and in 
heaven, and could not be an- 
nulled, according to the decrees 
of the great Jehovah. This is a 
faithful saying. Who can hear 
it? 

10. And again, for the prece- 
dent, Matthew 16:18, 19: And 
I say also unto thee, That thou art 
Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church; and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against iU 
And I will give unto thee the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven: and 
whatsoever thou shalt bind on 
earth shall be bound in heaven; 
and whatsoever thou shalt loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 

11. Now the great and grand 
secret of the whole matter, and the 
summum bonum of the whole sub- 
ject that is lying before us, con- 
sists in obtaining the powers of 
the Holy Priesthood. For him to 
whom these keys are given there 
is no difficulty in obtaining a 
knowledge of facts in relation to 
the salvation of the children of 
men, both as well for the dead 
as for the living. 

12. Herein is glory and honor, 
and immortality and eternal life

— The ordinance of baptism by- 
water, to be immersed therein in 
order to m answer to the likeness 
of the dead, that one principle 
might accord with the other; to 
be immersed in the water and 
come forth out of the water is 
in the likeness of the resurrec- 
tion of the dead in coming forth 
out of their graves; hence, this 
ordinance was instituted to form 
a relationship with the ordinance 
of baptism for the dead, being in 
likeness of the dead. 

13. Consequently, the "baptis- 
mal font was instituted as a simil- 
itude of the grave, and was com- 
manded to be in a place under- 
neath where the living are wont 
to assemble, to show forth the 
living and the dead, and that all 
things may have their likeness, 
and that they may accord one 
with another — that which is 
earthly conforming to that which 
is heavenly, as Paul hath de- 
clared, 1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, 
and 48: 

14. Howbeit that was not first 
which is spiritual, but that which 
is natural; and ,afterward that 
which is spiritual. The first man 
is of the earth, earthy; the second 
man is the Lord from heaven. As 
is the earthy, such are they also 
that are earthy; and as is the 
heavenly, such are they also that 
are heavenly. And as are the 
•records on the earth in relation 
to your dead, which are truly 
made out, so also are the records 
in heaven. This, therefore, is the 
sealing and binding power, and, 
in one sense of the word, the 
'keys of the kingdom, which con- 
sist in the key of knowledge. 

15. And now, my dearly be- 
loved brethren and sisters, let me 
assure you that these are prin- 



ciples in relation to the dead and 
the living that cannot be lightly 
passed over, as pertaining to our 
salvation. For their salvation is 
necessary and essential to our 
salvation, as Paul says concerning 
the fathers — that they without us 
cannot be made perfect — neither 
can «we without our dead be 
made perfect. 

16. And now* in relation to the 
baptism for the dead, I will give 
you another quotation of Paul, 1 
Corinthians 15:29: Else what 
shall they do which are baptized 
for the dead, if the dead rise not 
at all? Why are they then bap- 
tized for the deadt 

17. And again, in connection 
with this quotation I will give 
you a quotation from one of the 
prophets, who had his eye fixed 
on the restoration of the priest- 
hood, the glories to be revealed 
in the last days, and in an espe- 
cial manner this most glorious of 
all subjects belonging to the ever- 
lasting gospel, namely, the bap- 
tism for the dead; for Malachi 
says, last chapter, verses 5 th and 
6 th : Behold, I will send you r Elijah 
the prophet before the coming of 
the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord : And he shall turn the 'heart 
of the fathers to the children, and 
the heart of the children to their 
fathers, lest I come and smite the 
earth with a curse, 

18. I might have rendered a 
plainer translation to this, but it 
is sufficiently plain to suit my 
purpose as it stands. It is suffi- 
cient to know, in this case, that 
the earth will be smitten with a 
curse unless there is a welding 
link of some kind or other be- 
tween the fathers and the chil- 
dren, upon some subject or other 
— and behold what is that sub-

ject? It is the 'baptism for the 
dead. For we without them can- 
not be made perfect; neither can 
they without us be made perfect. 
Neither can they nor we be made 
perfect without those who have 
died in the gospel also; for it is 
necessary in the*, ushering in of 
the dispensation of the fulness 
of times, which "dispensation is 
now beginning to usher in, that 
a whole and complete and per- 
fect union, and welding together 
of dispensations, and keys, and 
powers, and glories should take 
place, and be revealed from the 
days of Adam even to the present 
time. And not only this, but 
those things which never have 
been revealed from the founda- 
tion of the world, but have been 
kept hid from the wise and pru- 
dent, shall be revealed unto 
"babes and sucklings in this, the 
dispensation of the fulness of 
times. 

19. Now, what do we hear in 
the gospel which we have re- 
ceived? A voice of gladness! A 
voice of mercy from heaven; and 
a voice of "truth out of the earth; 
glad tidings for the dead; a voice 
of gladness for the living and the 
dead; glad tidings of great joy. 
How beautiful upon the moun- 
tains are the feet of those that 
bring glad tidings of good things, 
and that say unto Zion: Behold, 
thy God reign eth! As the dews 
of Carmel, so shall the knowledge 
of God descend upon them! 

20. And again, what do we 
hear? Glad tidings from Cumo- 
rah! Moroni, an angel from 
heaven, declaring the fulfilment 
of the prophets — 'the book to be 
revealed. A voice of the Lord in 
the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca 



county, declaring the 'three wit- 
nesses to bear record of the book! 
The voice of 'Michael on the 
banks of the Susquehanna, de- 
tecting the devil when he ap- 
peared as an angel of light! The ' 
voice of 2a Peter, James, and John 
in the wilderness between Har- 
mony, Susquehanna county, and 
Colesville, Broome county, on the 
Susquehanna river, declaring 
themselves as possessing the 
keys of the kingdom, and of the 
dispensation of the fulness of 
times! 

21. And again, the voice of God 
in the chamber of old Father 
Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca 
county, and at sundry times, and 
in divers places through all the 
travels and tribulations of this 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints! And the voice of 
26 Michael, the archangel; the 
voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, 
and of divers angels, from Michael 
or Adam down to the present 
time, all declaring their dispensa- 
tion, their rights, their keys, their 
honors, their majesty and glory, 
and the power of their priest- 
hood; giving line upon line, pre- 
cept upon precept; here a little, 
and there a little; giving us con- 
solation by holding forth that 
which is to come, confirming our 
hope! 

22. Brethren, shall we not go 
on in so great a cause? Go for- 
ward and not backward. Cour- 
age, brethren; and on, on to the 
victory! Let your hearts rejoice, 
and be exceedingly glad. Let the 
earth break forth into singing. 
Let the 2c dead speak forth an- 
thems of eternal praise to the 
King Immanuel, who hath or- 
dained, before the world was, that

which would enable us to redeem 
them out of their 2d prison; for

23. Let the mountains shout 
for joy, and all ye valleys cry 
aloud; and all ye seas and dry 
lands tell the wonders of your 
Eternal King! And ye rivers, 
and brooks, and rills, flow down 
with gladness. Let the woods and 
all the trees of the field praise the 
Lord; and ye solid rocks weep 
for joy! And let the sun, moon, 
and the morning stars sing to- 
gether, and let all the sons of 
God shout for joy! And let the 
eternal creations declare his name 
forever and ever! And again I 
say, how glorious is the voice we 
hear from heaven, proclaiming in 
our ears, glory, and salvation, and 
honor, and immortality, and eter- 
nal life; kingdoms, principalities, 
and powers! 

24. Behold, the great day of 
the Lord is at hand; and who can 



abide the day of his coming, and 
who can stand when he appear- 
eth? For he is like a refiner's 
fire, and like fuller's soap; and 
he shall sit as a refiner and puri- 
fier of silver, and he shall purify 
the sons of Levi, and purge them 
as gold and silver, that they may 
offer unto the Lord an offering in 
righteousness. Let us, therefore, 
as a church and a people, and as 
Latter-day Saints, offer unto the 
Lord an offering in righteous- 
ness; and let us present in his 
2 *holy temple, when it is finished, 
a 2/ book containing the records 
of our dead, which shall be 
worthy of all acceptation. 

25. Brethren, I have many 
things to say to you on the sub- 
ject; but shall now close for the 
present, and continue the subject 
another time. I am, as ever, your 
humble servant and never deviat- 
ing friend, 

Joseph Smith. 



SECTION 129. 



Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illi- 
nois, February 9, 1843, making known the three grand keys by which 

good or bad angels or spirits may be distinguished. Two kinds of 

beings besides mortals — Resurrected personages having bodies of flesh 
and bones — Disembodied spirits and spirits that have never been em- 
bodied — Means of detection. 

1. There are two kinds of 
beings in heaven, namely: An- 
gels, who are resurrected per- 
sonages, having a bodies of flesh 
and bones — 

2. For instance, Jesus said: 
Handle me and see, for a spirit 
hath not flesh and bones, as ye see 
me have. 

3. Secondly: The Spirits of 
just men made perfect, they who 



are not resurrected, but inherit 
the same glory. 

4. When a messenger comes 
saying he has a message from 
God, offer him your hand and re- 
quest him to shake hands with 
you. 

5. If he be an angel he will do 
so, and you will feel his hand. 

6. If he be the spirit of a just 
man made perfect he will come

Jin his glory; for that is the only 
" , way he can appear — 

7. Ask him to shake hands 
"with you, but he will not move, 
^because it is contrary to the order 
of heaven for a just man to de- 
ceive; but he will still deliver 
liis message. 

8. If it be the devil as an angel 



of light, when you ask him to 
shake hands he will offer you his 
hand, and you will not feel any- 
thing; you may therefore detect 
him. 

9. These are c three grand 
keys whereby you may know 
whether any administration is 
from God. 



SECTION 130. 

Important Items op Instruction given by Joseph Smith the 

Prophet, at Ramus, Illinois, April 2, 1843. When the Savior 

appears he will be in his true form, that of a man — The abode of the 
angels — The earth in its sanctified and immortalized condition — Proph- 
ecy of great difficulties involving much bloodshed to begin in South 
Carolina — Time of the Lord's coming not definitely made known — 
Intelligence acquired in this life will abide with its possessor — The law 
decreed in heaven, that blessings are obtained only by obedience to the 
laws upon which they are predicated — The Father and the Son possess 
bodies of flesh and bones — The Holy Ghost a personage of spirit. 

1. When the Savior shall ap- 
pear we shall see him as he is. 
We shall see that he is a man 
like ourselves. 

2. And that same sociality 
which exists among us here will 
exist among us there, only it will 
be coupled with eternal glory, 
which glory we do not now enjoy. 

3. John 14 : 23 — The appearing 
of the Father and the Son, in that 
verse, is a personal appearance; 
and the idea that the Father and 
the Son dwell in a man's heart 
is an old sectarian notion, and is 
false. 

4. In answer to the question — 
Is not the reckoning of God's 
time, angel's time, prophet's time, 
and man's time, according to the 
planet on which they reside? 

5. I answer, Yes. But there 
are no angels who minister to 
this earth but those who do be- 
long or have belonged to it. 

c» vera. 1 — 8. 



6. The angels do not reside on 
a planet like this earth; 

7. But they reside in the pres- 
ence of God, on a globe like a sea 
of glass and fire, where all things 
for their glory are manifest, past, 
present, and future, and are con- 
tinually before the Lord. 

8. The place where God re- 
sides is a great Urim and Thum- 
mim. 

9. This earth, in its sanctified 
and immortal state, will be made 
like unto crystal and will be a 
Urim and Thummim to the in- 
habitants who dwell thereon, 
whereby all things pertaining to 
an inferior kingdom, or all king- 
doms of a lower order, will be 
manifest to those who dwell on 
it; and this earth will be Christ's. 

10. Then the white stone men- 
tioned in Revelation 2:17, will 
become a Urim and Thummim to 
each individual who receives one, 



238 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 131. 



whereby things pertaining to a 
higher order of kingdoms will 
be made known; 

11. And a white stone is given 
to each of those who come into 
the celestial kingdom, whereon 
is a new name written, which no 
man knoweth save he that re- 
ceive th it. The new name is the 
key word. 

12. I prophesy, in the name of 
the Lord God, that the commence- 
ment of the difficulties which will 
cause much bloodshed previous 
to the coming of the Son of Man 
will be in South Carolina. 

13. It may probably arise 
through the slave question. This 
a voice declared to me, while I 
was praying earnestly on the sub- 
ject, December 25th, 1832. 

14. I was once praying very 
earnestly to know the time of the 
coming of the Son of Man, when 
I heard a voice repeat the follow- 
ing: 

15. Joseph, my son, if thou 
livest until thou art eighty-five 
years old, thou shalt see the face 
of the Son of Man; therefore let 
this suffice, and trouble me no 
more on this matter. 

16. I was left. thus, without 
being able to decide whether this 
coming referred to the beginning 



of the millennium or to some 
previous appearing, or whether I 
should die and thus see his face, j 

17. I believe the coming of the I 
Son of Man will not be any sooner  
than that time. 

18. Whatever principle of in- 
telligence we attain unto in this 
life, it will. rise with us in the 
resurrection. 

19. And if a person gains more 
knowledge and intelligence in this 
life through his diligence and 
obedience than another, he will 
have so much the advantage in 
the world to come. 

20. There is a law, irrevocably 
decreed in heaven before the 
foundations of this world, upon 
which all blessings are predi- 
cated — 

21. And when we obtain any 
blessing from God, it is by obe- 
dience to that law upon which it 
is predicated. 

22. The Father has a body of 
flesh and bones as tangible as 
man's; the Son also; but the Holy 
Ghost has not a body of flesh and 
bones, but is a personage of Spirit. 
Were it not so, the Holy Ghost 
could not dwell in us. 

23. A man may receive the 
Holy Ghost, and it may descend 
upon him and not tarry with him.

sure word of prophecy means a 
man's "knowing that he is sealed 
up unto eternal life, by revela- 
tion and the spirit of prophecy, 
through the power of the Holy 
Priesthood. 



6. It is impossible for a man 
to be saved in ignorance. 

7. There is no such thing as 
immaterial matter. All spirit is 
matter, but it is more fine or 
pure, and can only be discerned 
by purer eyes; 

8. We cannot see it; but when 
our bodies are purified we shall 
see that it is all matter. 



SECTION 132. 



Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, 
Illinois, recorded July 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting 
covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant, as also 

plurality of wives. The Prophet's inquiry of the Lord — He is told 

to prepare himself to receive the new and everlasting covenant — Con- 
ditions of this law — The power of the Holy Priesthood instituted by 
the Lord must be operative in ordinances to be in effect beyond the 
grave — Marriage by secular authority is- of effect during mortality 
only — Though the form of marriage should make it appear to be for 
time and eternity, the ordinance is not valid beyond the grave unless 
solemnized by the authority of the Holy Priesthood as the Lord directs — 
Marriage duly authorized for time and eternity to be attended by sur- 
passing blessings — Essentials for the attainment of the status of god- 
hood — The meaning of eternal lives — Plurality of wives acceptable only 
when commanded by the Lord — The sin of adultery— Commandment to 
Emma Smith, wife of the Prophet. 



1. Verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you my servant Joseph, that 
inasmuch as you have inquired 
of my hand to know and under- 
stand wherein I, the Lord, justi- 
fied my servants Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, as also Moses, David 
and Solomon, my servants, as 
touching the principle and doc- 
trine of their having a many wives 
and concubines — 

2. Behold, and lo, I am the 



Lord thy God, and will answer 
thee as touching this matter. 

3. Therefore, prepare thy heart 
to receive and obey the instruc- 
tions which I am about to give 
unto you; for all those who have 
this law revealed unto them "must 
obey the same. 

4. For behold, I reveal unto 
you a c new and an everlasting 
covenant; and if ye abide not that 
^covenant, then are ye damned;

DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 132. 



for no one can 'reject this cove- 
nant and be permitted to enter 
into my glory. 

5. For all who will have a 
blessing at my hands shall 'abide 
the law which was appointed for 
that blessing, and the conditions 
thereof, as were 'instituted from 
before the foundation of the 
world. 

6. And as pertaining to the 
*new and everlasting covenant, it 
was instituted for the fulness of 
my glory; and he that receiveth 
a fulness thereof 'must and shall 
abide the law, or he shall be 
damned, saith the Lord God. 

7. And verily I say unto you, 
that the 'conditions of this law 
are these: All covenants, con- 
tracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, 
vows, performances, connections, 
associations, or expectations, that 
are not made and entered into 
and ^sealed by the Holy Spirit of 
promise, of him who is anointed, 
both as well for time and for all 
eternity, and that too most holy, 
by revelation and commandment 
through the medium of mine 
anointed, whom I have appointed 
on the earth to hold this power 
(and I have appointed unto my 
servant Joseph to hold this power 
in the last days, and there is 
never but one on the earth at a 
time on whom this power and the 
keys of this priesthood are con- 
ferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, 
or force in and after the resur- 
rection from the dead; for all 
contracts that are not made unto 
this end have an end when men 
are dead. 

8. Behold, mine house is a 
house of order, saith the Lord 
God, and not a house of con- 
fusion. 

9. Will I accept of an offering, 



saith the Lord, that is not made 
in my name? 

10. Or will I receive at your 
hands that which I have not ap- 
pointed? 

11. And will I appoint unto 
you, saith the Lord, except it be 
by l law, even as I and my Father 
m ordained unto you, before the 
world was? 

12. I am the Lord thy God; 
and I give unto you this com- 
mandment — that no man shall 
come unto the Father but by me 
or by my word, which is my law, 
saith the Lord. 

13. And everything that is in 
the world, whether it be ordained 
of men, by thrones, or princi- 
palities, or powers, or things of 
name, whatsoever they may be, 
that are not by me or by my 
word, saith the Lord, shall be 
thrown down, and shall "not re- 
main after men are dead, neither 
in nor after the resurrection, 
saith the Lord your God. 

14. For whatsoever things •re- 
main are by me; and whatsoever 
things are not by me shall be 
shaken and destroyed. 

15. Therefore, if a man marry 
him a wife in the world, and he 
marry her not by me nor by my 
word, and he covenant with her 
so long as he is in the world and 
she with him, their 'covenant and 
marriage are not of force when 
they are dead, and when they are 
out of the world; therefore, they 
are not bound by any law when 
they are out of the world. 

16. Therefore, when they are 
«out of the world they neither 
marry nor are given in marriage; 
but are appointed angels in heav- 
en; which angels are ministering 
servants, to minister for those 
who are worthy of a far more,

sent. I am he. Receive ye, 
therefore, my law. 

25. Broad is the gate, and 
fi6 wide the way that leadeth to the 
deaths; and many there are that 
go in thereat, because they re- 
ceive me not, neither do they 
abide in my law. 

26. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, if a man 2c marry a wife ac- 
cording to my word, and they are 
"sealed by the Holy Spirit of 
promise, according to mine ap- 
pointment, and he or she shall 
commit any sin or transgression 
of the 2c new and everlasting cove- 
nant whatever, and all manner of 
blasphemies, and if they commit 
no murder wherein they shed in- 
nocent blood, yet 2 'they shall 
come forth in the first resurrec- 
tion, and enter into their exalta- 
tion; but they shall be ^destroyed 
in the flesh, and shall be delivered 
unto the 2h buffetings of Satan 
unto the day of redemption, saith 
the Lord God. 

27. The blasphemy against the 
Holy Ghost, which shall not be 
forgiven in the world nor out of 
the world, is in that ye 2&lt; commit 
murder wherein ye shed innocent 
blood, and assent unto my death, 
after ye have received my 2i new 
and everlasting covenant, saith 
the Lord God; and he that abideth 
not this law can in nowise enter 
into my glory, but shall be 
damned, saith the Lord. 

28. I am the Lord thy God, and 
will give unto thee the law of my 
Holy Priesthood, as was ordained 
by me and my Father before the 
world was. 

29. Abraham received all 
things, whatsoever he received, 
by revelation and commandment, 
by my word, saith the Lord, and 



2 *hath entered into his exaltation 
and sitteth upon his throne. 

30. Abraham received prom- 
ises concerning his seed, and of 
the fruit of his loins — from whose 
loins 2l ye are, namely, my servant 
Joseph — which were to continue 
so long as they were in the world; 
and as touching Abraham and his 
seed, 2m out of the world they 
should continue; both in the 
world and out of the world should 
they continue as innumerable as 
the stars; or, if ye were to count 
the sand upon the seashore ye 
could not number them. 

31. This promise is yours also, 
because ye are of Abraham, and 
the promise was made unto Abra- 
ham; and by this law is the con- 
tinuation of the works of my Fa- 
ther, wherein he glorifieth him- 
self. 

32. Go ye, therefore, and do 
the 2n works of Abraham; enter ye 
into my law and ye shall be saved. 

33. But if ye enter not into my 
law ye cannot receive the promise 
of my Father, which he made 
unto Abraham. 

34. God commanded Abraham, 
and Sarah 2o gave Hagar to Abra- 
ham to wife. And why did she 
do it? Because this was the law; 
and from Hagar sprang many 
people. This, therefore, was ful- 
filling, among other things, the 
promises. 

35. Was Abraham, therefore, 
under condemnation? Verily I 
say unto you, Nay; for I, the 
Lord, commanded it. 

36. Abraham was commanded 
to offer his son Isaac; neverthe- 
less, it was written: Thou shalt 
not kill. Abraham, however, did 
not refuse, and it was accounted 
unto him for righteousness.

37. Abraham received concu- 
bines, and they bore him chil- 
dren; and it was accounted unto 
him for righteousness, because 
they were 2p given unto him, and 
he abode in my law; as Isaac also 
and Jacob did none other things 
than that which they were com- 
manded; and because they did 
none other things than that which 
they were commanded, they have 
entered into their exaltation, ac- 
cording to the promises, and sit 
upon thrones, and are not angels 
but 2 «are gods. 

38. David also received many 
wives and concubines, and also 
Solomon and Moses my servants, 
as also many others of my ser- 
vants, from the beginning of crea- 
tion until this time; and in noth- 
ing did they sin save in those 
things which they 2r received not 
of me. 

39. David's wives and concu- 
bines were 2 *given unto him of 
me, by the hand of Nathan, my 
servant, and others of the proph- 
ets who had the keys of this 
power; and in none of these 
things did he sin against me save 
in the case of Uriah and his wife; 
and, therefore he hath fallen 
from his exaltation, and received 
his portion; and he shall 2 'not 
inherit them out of the world, 
for I gave them unto another, 
saith the Lord. 

40. I am the Lord thy God, and 
I gave unto thee, my servant Jo- 
seph, an appointment, and restore 
all things. Ask what ye will, and 
it shall be given unto you accord- 
ing to my word. 

41. And as ye have asked con- 
cerning adultery, verily, verily, I 
8ay unto you, if a man 2tt receiveth 
a wife in the new and everlasting 



covenant, and if she be with an- 
other man, and I have not ap- 
pointed unto her by the holy 
anointing, she hath committed 
adultery and shall be destroyed. 

42. If she be not in the new 
and everlasting covenant, and 
she be with another man, she has 
2 "committed adultery. 

43. And if her husband be with 
another woman, and he was un- 
der a vow, he hath broken his 
vow and 2w hath committed adul- 
tery. 

44. And if she hath not com- 
mitted adultery, but is innocent 
and hath not broken her vow, and 
she knoweth it, and I reveal it 
unto you, my servant Joseph, then 
shall you have power, by the 
power of my Holy Priesthood, to 
take her and give her unto him 
that 2x hath not committed adul- 
tery but hath been faithful; for 
he shall be made ruler over 
2v many. 

45. For I have conferred upon 
you the keys and power of the 
priesthood, wherein I restore 2 *all 
things, and make known unto you 
all things in due time. 

46. And verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that 8a whatsoever you 
seal on earth shall be sealed in 
heaven; and whatsoever you 
86 bind on earth, in my name and by 
my word, saith the Lord, it shall 
be eternally bound in the heav- 
ens; and whosesoever sins you 
3c remit on earth shall be remit- 
ted eternally in the heavens ; and 
whosesoever sins you 8d retain on 
earth shall be retained in heaven. 

47. And again, verily I say, 
"'whomsoever you bless I will 
bless, and whomsoever you 8 'curse 
I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, 
the Lord, am thy God.

48. And again, verily I say unto 
you, my servant Joseph, that 
whatsoever you give on earth, 
and to whomsoever you 8 "give any 
one on earth, by my word and ac- 
cording to my law, it shall be 
visited with blessings and not 
cursings, and with my power, 
saith the Lord, and shall be with- 
out condemnation on earth and 
in heaven. 

49. For I am the Lord thy God, 
and will be with thee even unto 
the end of the world, and through 
all eternity; for verily I "seal 
upon you your exaltation, and 
prepare a Si throne for you in the 
kingdom of my Father, with 
Abraham your father. 

50. Behold, I have seen your 
sacrifices, and will forgive all 
your sins; I have seen your sacri- 
fices in obedience to that which 
I have told you. Go, therefore, 
and I make a way for your escape, 
as I accepted the offering of Abra- 
ham of his son Isaac. 

51. Verily, I say unto you: A 
commandment I give unto mine 
handmaid, Emma Smith, your 
wife, whom I have given unto 
you, that she stay herself and 
partake not of that which I com- 
manded you to offer unto her; 
for I did it, saith the Lord, to 
prove you all, as I did Abraham, 
and that I might require an offer- 
ing at your hand, by covenant and 
sacrifice. 

52. And let mine handmaid, 
Emma Smith, receive si all those 
that have been given unto my ser- 
vant Joseph, and who are virtu- 
ous and pure before me; and 
those who are not pure, and have 
said they were pure, shall be de- 
stroyed, saith the Lord God. 

53. For I am the Lord thy God, 
and ye shall obey my voice; and 



I give unto my servant Joseph 
that he shall be made ruler over 
many things; for he hath been 
faithful over a few things, and 
from henceforth I will strengthen 
him. 

5 4 . And I command mine hand- 
maid, Emma Smith, to abide and 
cleave unto my servant Joseph, 
and to none else. But if she will 
not abide this commandment she 
shall be destroyed, saith the 
Lord ; for I am the Lord thy God, 
and will destroy her if she abide 
not in my law. 

55. But if she will not abide 
this commandment, then shall my 
servant Joseph do all things for 
her, even as he hath said; and 
I will bless him and multiply 
him and give unto him an "hun- 
dred-fold in this world, of fathers 
and mothers, brothers and sisters, 
houses and lands, wives and chil- 
dren, and crowns of eternal lives 
in the eternal worlds. 

56. And again, verily I say, let 
mine handmaid forgive my ser- 
vant Joseph his trespasses; and 
then shall she be forgiven her 
trespasses, wherein she has tres- 
passed against me; and I, the 
Lord thy God, will bless her, and 
multiply her, and make her heart 
to rejoice. 

57. And again, I say, let not 
my servant Joseph put his prop- 
erty out of his hands, lest an 
enemy come and destroy him ; for 
Satan seeketh to destroy; for I 
am the Lord thy God, and he is 
my servant; and behold, and lo, 
I am with him, as I was with 
Abraham, thy father, even unto 
his exaltation and glory. 

58. Now, as touching the law 
of the priesthood, there are many 
things pertaining thereunto. 

59. Verily, if a man be called

of my Father, as was Aaron, by 
mine own voice, and by the voice 
of him that sent me, and I have 
endowed him with the keys of 
the power of this priesthood, if 
he do anything in my name, and 
according to my law and by my 
word, he will not commit sin, 
and I will justify him. 

60. Let no one, therefore, set 
on my servant Joseph; for I will 
justify him; for he shall do the 
sacrifice which I require at his 
bands for his transgressions, saith 
the Lord your God. 

61. And again, as pertaining 
to the law of the priesthood — If. 
any man espouse a virgin, and 
desire to espouse another, and 
the first give her consent, and if 
he espouse the second, and they 
are virgins, and have vowed to 
no other man, then is he justified; 
he cannot commit adultery for 
they are 8I given unto him; for he 
cannot commit adultery with that 
that belongeth unto him and to 
no one else. 

62. And if he have ten virgins 
given unto him by this law, 8m he 
cannot commit adultery, for they 
belong to him, and they are given 
unto him; therefore is he justi- 
fied. 

63. But if one or either of the 
ten virgins, after she is espoused, 
shall be with another man, she 
has '"committed* adultery, and 
shall be destroyed; for they are 
given unto him to multiply and 
replenish the earth, according to 



my commandment, and to fulfil 
the promise which was given by 
my Father 3o before the founda- 
tion of the world, 'and for their 
exaltation in the eternal worlds, 
that they may bear Sp the souls of 
men; for herein is the work of 
my Father continued, that he may 
be glorified. 

64. And again, verily, verily, 
I say unto you, if any man have 
a wife, who holds the keys of this 
power, and he teaches unto her 
the s «law of my priesthood, as 
pertaining to these things, then 
shall she believe and administer 
unto him, or she shall be de- 
stroyed, saith the Lord your God; 
for I will destroy her; for I will 
magnify my name upon all those 
who receive and abide in my 
law. 

65. Therefore, it shall be law- 
ful in me, if she receive not this

whatsoever I, the Lord his God, 
will give unto him, because she 
did not believe and administer 
unto him according to my word; 
and she then becomes the trans- 
gressor; and he is exempt from 
the law of Sarah, who admin- 
istered unto Abraham according 
to the law when I s *commanded 
Abraham to take Hagar to wife.

this law, verily, verily, I say unto 
you, I will reveal more unto you, 
hereafter; therefore, let this suf- 
fice for the present. Behold, I am 
Alpha and Omega. Amen.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, 
Ohio, November 3, 1831. Prefacing this revelation the Prophet wrote : 
At this time there were many things which the Elders desired to know, 
relative to preaching the Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, and

concerning the gathering; and in order to walk by the true light, and 
be instructed from on high, on the 3rd of November, 1831, I inquired 
of the Lord and received the following important revelation, which has 
since been added to the book of Doctrine and Covenants and called the 

Appendix. A proclamation to the people of the Church to gather 

to Zion — This proclamation to be carried by the Elders to the peoples 
of the world — Zion and Jerusalem both to be established — The voice 
of the Lord to issue from each of these centers — The Lost Tribes to be 
remembered by the Lord and to be brought forth from the north 
countries— These to receive their blessings at the hand of Ephraim— 
Graves of the Saints to be opened at the coming of the Lord — The 
doom of those who reject the Lord's message. 



1. Hearken, O ye people of 
•my church, saith the Lord your 
God, and hear the word of the 
Lord concerning you — 

2. The Lord who shall "sud- 
denly come to his temple; the 
Lord who shall come 'down upon 
the world with a curse to judg- 
ment; yea, upon all the nations 
that forget God, and upon all the 
ungodly among you. 

3. For he shall make d bare his 
holy arm in the eyes of all the 
nations, and all the ends of the 
earth shall see the salvation of 
their God. 

4. Wherefore, prepare ye, pre- 
pare ye, O my people; sanctify 
yourselves; e gather ye together, 
O ye people of my church, upon 
the land of Zion, all you that 
have not been commanded to 
tarry. 

5. Go ye 'out from Babylon. 
Be ye clean that bear the vessels 
of the Lord. 

6. Call your "solemn assem- 
blies, and speak often one to an- 
other. And let every man call 
upon the name of the Lord. 

7. Yea, verily I say unto you 
again, the time has come when 
the voice of the Lord is unto you: 
*Go ye out of Babylon; *gather ye 



out from among the nations, from 
the four winds, from one end of 
heaven to the other. 

8. Send forth the elders of 'my 
church unto *the nations which 
are afar off; unto the islands of 
the sea; send forth unto foreign 
lands; call upon all nations, first 
'upon the Gentiles, and then 
m upon the Jews. 

9. And behold, and lo, this 
shall be their cry, and the voice 
of the Lord unto all people: "Go 
ye forth unto the land of Zion, 
that the borders of my people may 
be enlarged, and that her "stakes 
may be strengthened, and that 
Zion may go forth unto the re- 
gions round about. 

10. Yea, let the cry go forth 
among all people: Awake and 
arise and go forth to *meet the 
Bridegroom; behold and lo, the 
Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to 
meet him. Prepare yourselves 
for the «great day of the Lord. 

11. Watch, therefore, for ye 
know neither the day nor the 
hour. 

12. Let them, therefore, who 
are r among the Gentiles flee unto 
Zion.

'Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto

house. 

14. Go ye out from among the 
nations, 'even from Babylon, from 
the midst of, wickedness, which 
is spiritual Babylon. 

15. But verily, thus saith the 
Lord, let not your flight be in 
v haste, but let all things be pre- 
pared before you; and he that 
goeth, let him not v look back lest 
sudden destruction shall come 
upon him. 

16. Hearken and hear, O ye in- 
habitants of the earth. Listen, 
ye elders of "my church together, 
and hear the voice of the Lord; 
for he calleth upon all men, and 
he commandeth 'all men every- 
where to repent. 

17. For behold, the Lord God 
hath 'sent forth the angel crying 
through the midst of heaven, 
saying: Prepare ye the way of 
the Lord, and make his paths 
straight, for the 'hour of his com- 
ing is nigh — 

18. When the Lamb shall 
Sa stand upon Mount Zion, and 
with him a hundred and forty- 
four thousand, having his Fa- 
ther's name written on their fore- 
heads. 

19. Wherefore, prepare ye for 
the 26 coming of the Bridegroom; 
go ye, go ye out to meet him. 

20. For behold, he shall 2c stand 
upon the mount of Olivet, and 
upon the mighty ocean, even the 
great deep, and upon the islands 
of the sea, and "upon the land of 
Zion. 

21. And he shall 2e utter his 
voice out of Zion, and he shall 
2 'speak from Jerusalem, and his 
"voice shall be heard among all 
people; 



22. And it shall be a voice as 
the 2 *voice of many waters, and 
as the voice of a great thunder, 
which 2 'shall break down the 
mountains, and the ''valleys shall 
not be found. 

23. He shall command the 
great deep, and it shall be driven 
back into the north countries, 
and the "islands shall become 
one land; 

24. And the land of Jerusalem 
and the land of Zion shall be 
turned back into their own place, 
and the earth shall be like as it 
was in the days 2I before it was 
divided. 

25. And the Lord, even the 
Savior, shall stand in the midst 
of his people, and shall 2m reign 
over all flesh. 

26. And they who are in the 
2n north countries shall come in 
remembrance before the Lord; 
and their prophets shall hear his 
voice, and shall no longer stay 
themselves; and they shall smite 
the rocks, and the ice shall flow 
down at their presence. 

27. And an 2o highway shall be 
cast up in the midst of the great 
deep. 

28. Their enemies shall be- 
come a prey unto them, 

29. Arid in the 2p barren deserts 
there shall come forth pools of 
living water; and the 2 «parched 
ground shall no longer be a 
thirsty land. 

30. And they shall bring forth 
their rich treasures unto the chil- 
dren of Ephraim, my servants. 

31. And the boundaries of the 
2r everlasting hills shall tremble at 
their presence. 

32. And there shall they fall 
down and be crowned with glory,

even in Zion, by the hands of the 
servants of the Lord, even the 
2 *children of Ephraim. 

33. And they shall be filled 
with 2 'songs of everlasting joy. 

34. Behold, this is the blessing 
of the everlasting God upon the 
tribes of Israel, and the 2u richer 
blessing upon the head of Eph- 
raim and his fellows. 

35. And they also of the tribe 
of Judah, 2v after their pain shall 
be sanctified in holiness before 
the Lord, to dwell in his presence 
day and night, forever and ever. 

36. And now, verily saith the 
Lord, that these things might be 
known among you, O inhabitants 
of the earth, I have 2w sent forth 
mine angel flying through the 
midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel, who hath appeared 
unto 2 *some and hath committed 
it unto man, who shall appear 
unto 2y many that dwell on the 
earth. 

37. And this gospel shall be 
preached 2 *unto every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people. 

38. And the servants of God 
shall go forth, saying with a loud 
voice: Fear God and give glory 
to him, for the hour of his judg- 
ment is come; 

3 9 . And worship him that made 
heaven, and earth, and the sea, 
and the fountains of waters — 

40. Calling upon the name of 
the Lord day and night, saying: 
O that thou wouldst Sa rend the 
heavens, that thou wouldst come 
down, that the mountains might 
flow down at thy presence. 

41. And it shall be answered 
upon their heads; for the pres- 
ence of the Lord shall be as the 
"melting fire that burneth, and 



as the fire which causeth the wa- 
ters to boil. 

42. O Lord, thou shalt come 
down to make thy name known 
to thine adversaries, and all na- 
tions shall 8c tremble at thy pres- 
ence — 

43. When thou doest "terrible 
things, things they look not for; 

44. Yea, when thou comest 
down, and the ''mountains flow 
down at thy presence, thou shalt 
meet him who rejoiceth and work- 
eth righteousness, who remem- 
bereth thee in thy ways. 

45. For since the beginning of 
the world have not men heard 
nor perceived by the ear, neither 
hath any eye seen, O God, besides 
thee, how "great things thou 
hast prepared for him that wait- 
eth for thee. 

4 6. And it shall be said : "Who 
is this that cometh down from 
God in heaven with dyed gar- 
ments; yea, from the regions 
which are not known, clothed in 
his glorious apparel, traveling in 
the greatness of his strength? 

47. And he shall say: I am he 
who spake in righteousness, 
mighty to save. 

48. And the Lord shall be 
8 *red in his apparel, and his gar- 
ments like him that treadeth in 
the wine-vat. 

49. And so great shall be the 
"glory of his presence that the 
sun shall hide 8 'his face in shame, 
and the moon shall withhold its 
light, and the stars shall he 
8fc hurled from their places. 

50. And his voice . shall he 
heard: a, I have trodden the wine- 
press alone, and have brought 
judgment upon all people; and 
none were with me;

51. And I have trampled them 
In my fury, and I ,did tread upon 
them in mine anger, and their 
blood have I sprinkled upon my 
garments, and stained all my 
raiment; for this was the 8m day 
of vengeance which was in my 
heart. 

52. And now the 8n year of my 
redeemed is come ; and they shall 
mention the loving kindness of 
their Lord, and all that he has 
bestowed upon them according to 
his goodness, and according to 
his loving kindness, forever and 
ever. 

53. In all their afflictions he 
was afflicted. And the angel of 
his presence saved them; and in 
his love, and in his pity, he re- 
deemed them, and bore them, and 
carried them all the days of old; 

54. Yea, and Enoch also, and 
they who were with him; the 
prophets who were before him; 
and Noah also, and they who 
were before him; and Moses also, 
and they who were before him; 

55. And from Moses to 3o Eli jah, 
and from 8 *Elijah to John, who 
were with Christ in his resurrec- 
tion, and the holy apostles, with 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, shall 
be in the presence of the Lamb. 

56. And the 8 «graves of the 
saints shall be opened; and they 
shall come forth and stand on the 
right hand of the Lamb, when he 
shall 8r stand upon Mount Zion, 
and upon the holy city, the New 
Jerusalem; and they shall sing 
the song of the Lamb, day and 
night forever and ever. 

57. And for this cause, that 
men might be made partakers of 
the glories which were to be re- 
vealed, the Lord sent forth the 
fulness of his gospel, his ^ever- 



lasting covenant, reasoning in 
plainness and simplicity — 
. 58. To prepare the 8 'weak for 
those things which are coming on 
the earth, and for the Lord's er- 
rand in the day when the weak 
shall confound the wise, and 8u the 
little one become a strong nation, 
and 3,, two shall put their tens of 
thousands to flight. 

59. And by the weak things of 
the earth the Lord shall thrash 
the nations by the power of his 
Spirit. 

'60. And for this cause these 
commandments were given; they 
were commanded to be kept from 
the world in the day that they 
were given, but now are to aw go 
forth unto all flesh — 

61. And this according to the 
mind and will of the Lord, who 
ruleth over all flesh. 

62. And unto him that repent- 
eth and sanctifieth himself before 
the Lord shall be given eternal 
life. 

63. And upon them that heark- 
en not to the voice of the Lord 
shall be fulfilled that which was 
written by the prophet Moses, 
that they should be 8 *cut off from 
among the people. 

64. And also that which was 
written by the 8y prophet Malachi : 
For, behold, the day cometh that 
shall burn as an oven, and all the 
proud, yea, and all that do wick- 
edly, shall be stubble; and the 
day that cometh shall burn them 
up, saith the Lord of hosts, that 
it shall leave them neither root 
nor branch. 

65. Wherefore, this shall be 
the answer of the Lord unto 
them:

dry up the sea. I make the rivers 
a wilderness ; their fish stink, and

blackness, and make sackcloth 
their covering. 

70. And this shall ye have of 
my hand — 4a ye shall lie down in 
sorrow.

none to deliver you ; for ye obeyed 
not my voice when I called to yon 
out of the heavens; ye believed 
not my servants, and 4 *when they 
were sent unto you ye received 
them not. 

7 2. Wherefore, 40 they sealed up 
the testimony and bound up the 
law, and ye were delivered over 
unto darkness. 

73. These shall go away into

weeping, and wailing, and gnash- 
ing of teeth.

hath spoken it. Amen. 



SECTION 134. 



A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in 
general, adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, 
August 17, 1835, with the following preamble: That our belief with 
regard to earthly governments and laws' in general may not be misin- 
terpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought proper to present at 

the close of this volume our opinion concerning the same. This 

was inserted near the end of the Book of Commandments, as com- 
piled at that time. See History of the Church, vol. 2, p. 247. 



1. We believe that govern- 
ments were instituted of God for 
the benefit of man; and that he 
holds men accountable for their 
acts in relation to them, both in 
making laws and administering 
them, for the good and safety of 
society. 

2. We believe that no govern- 
ment can exist in peace, except 
such laws are framed and held 
inviolate as will secure to each 
individual the free exercise of 
conscience, the right and control 
of property, and the protection of 
life. 

3. We believe that all govern- 
ments necessarily require civil 



officers and magistrates to en- 
force the laws of the same; and 
that such as will administer the 
law in equity and justice should 
be sought for and upheld by the 
voice of the people if a republic, 
or the will of the sovereign. 

4. We believe that religion is 
instituted of God; and that men 
are amenable to him, and to him 
only, for the exercise of it, unless 
their religious opinions prompt 
them to infringe upon the rights 
and liberties of others; but we do 
not believe that human law has 
a right to interfere in prescribing 
rules of worship to bind the con- 
sciences of men, nor dictate forms 



3z, Isa. 50:2. 
4d, see e, sec. 19. 



4a, Isa. 50:11. 



4b, 2 Ne. 28:32. 4c, see d, sec. 1. 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 134. 



251 



for public or private devotion; 
that the civil magistrate should 
restrain crime, but never control 
conscience; should punish guilt, 
but never suppress the freedom 
of the soul. 

5. We believe that all men are 
bound to sustain and uphold the 
respective governments in which 
they reside, while protected in 
their inherent and inalienable 
rights by the laws of such govern- 
ments; and that sedition and re- 
bellion are unbecoming every citi- 
zen thus protected, and should be 
punished accordingly; and that 
all governments have a right to 
enact such laws as in their own 
judgments are best calculated to 
secure the public interest; at 
the same time, however, hold- 
ing sacred the freedom of con- 
science. 

6. We believe that every man 
should be honored in his station, 
rulers and magistrates as such, 
being placed for the protection of 
the innocent and the punishment 
of the guilty; and that to the 
laws all men owe respect and def- 
erence, as without them peace 
and harmony would be supplanted 
by anarchy and terror; human 
laws being instituted for the ex- 
press purpose of regulating our 
interests as individuals and na- 
tions, between man and man ; and 
divine laws given of heaven, pre- 
scribing rules on spiritual con- 
cerns, for faith and worship, both 
to be answered by man to his 
Maker. 

7. We believe that rulers, 
states, and governments have a 
right, and are bound to enact laws 
for the protection of all citizens 
in the free exercise of their re- 
ligious belief; but we do not be- 
lieve that they have a right in 
justice to deprive citizens of this 
privilege, or proscribe them in 



their opinions, so long as a re- 
gard and reverence are shown to 
the laws and such religious opin- 
ions do not justify sedition nor 
conspiracy. 

8. We believe that the commis- 
sion of crime should be punished 
according to the nature of ' the 
offense; that murder, treason, 
robbery, theft, and the breach of 
the general peace, in all respects, 
should be punished according to 
their criminality and their ten- 
dency to evil among men, by the 
laws of that government in which 
the offense is committed; and for 
the public peace and tranquility 
all men should step forward and 
use their ability in bringing of- 
fenders against good laws to pun- 
ishment. 

9. We do not believe it just to 
mingle religious influence with 
civil government, whereby one re- 
ligious society is fostered and an- 
other proscribed in its spiritual 
privileges, and the individual 
rights of its members, as citizens, 
denied. 

10. We believe that all reli- 
gious societies have a right to 
deal with their members for dis- 
orderly conduct, according to the 
rules and regulations of such so- 
cieties; provided that such deal- 
ings be for fellowship and good 
standing; but we do not believe 
that any religious society has 
authority to try men on the right 
of property or life, to take from 
them this world's goods, or to 
put them in jeopardy of either 
life or limb, or to inflict any 
physical punishment upon them. 
They can only excommunicate 
them from their society, and 
withdraw from them their fellow- 
ship. 

1 1 . We believe that men should 
appeal to the civil law for redress 
of all wrongs and grievances, 



252 



DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS, 135. 



where personal abuse is inflicted 
or the right of property or char- 
acter infringed, where such laws 
exist as will protect the same; 
but we believe that all men are 
justified in defending themselves, 
their friends, and property, and 
the government, from the unlaw- 
ful assaults and encroachments 
of all persons in times of exi- 
gency, where immediate appeal 
cannot be made to the laws, and 
relief afforded. 

12. We believe it just to preach 
the gospel to the nations of the 
earth, and warn the righteous to 



save themselves from the corrup- 
tion of the world; but we do not 
believe it right to interfere with 
bond-servants, neither preach the 
gospel to, nor baptize them con- 
trary to the will and wish of their 
masters, nor to meddle with or 
influence them in the least to 
cause them to be dissatisfied with 
their situations in this life, there- 
by jeopardizing the lives of men; 
such interference we believe to be 
unlawful and unjust, and dan- 
gerous to the peace of every gov- 
ernment allowing human beings 
to be held in servitude.

Martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and his brother, Hyrum 
Smith the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844. See History 
of the Church, vol. 6, p. 612. 



1. To seal the testimony of this 
book and the Book of Mormon, we 
announce the martyrdom of Jo- 
seph Smith the Prophet, and Hy- 
rum Smith the Patriarch. They 
were shot in Carthage jail, on the 
27th of June, 1844, about five 
o'clock p. m., by an armed mob — 
painted black — of from 150 to 
200 persons. Hyrum was shot 
first and fell calmly, exclaiming: 
I am a dead man! Joseph leaped 
from the window, and was shot 
dead in the attempt, exclaiming: 
Lord my God! They were both 
shot after they were dead, in a 
brutal manner, and both received 
four balls. 

2. John Taylor and Willard 
Richards, two of the Twelve, were 
the only persons in the room at 
the time; the former was wounded 
in a savage manner with four 
balls, but has since recovered; 
the latter, through the providence 
of God, escaped, without even a 
hole in his robe. 



3. Joseph Smith, the Prophet 
and Seer of the Lord, has done 
more, save Jesus only, for the 
salvation of men in this world, 
than any other man that ever 
lived in it. In the short space of 
twenty years, he has brought 
forth the Book of Mormon, which 
he translated by the gift and 
power of God, and has been the 
means of publishing it on two 
continents; has sent the fulness 
of the everlasting gospel, which 
it contained, to the four quarters 
of the earth; has brought forth 
the revelations and command- 
ments which compose this book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, and 
many other wise documents and 
instructions for the benefit of the 
children of men; gathered many 
thousands of the Latter-day 
Saints, founded a great city, and 
left a fame and name that can- 
not be slain. He lived great, and 
he died great in the eyes of God 
and his people; and like most of

the Lord's anointed in ancient 
times, has sealed his mission and 
his works with his own blood; 
and so has his brother Hyrum. 
In life they were not divided, and 
in death they were not sepa- 
rated ! 

4. When Joseph went to Car- 
thage to deliver himself up to the 
pretended requirements of the 
law, two or three days previous 
to his assassination, he said: "I 
am going like a lamb to the 
slaughter; but I am calm as a 
summer's morning; I have a con- 
science void of offense towards 
God, and towards all men. I 

SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL 
YET BE SAID OF ME — HE WAS MUR- 
DERED in cold blood." — The same 
morning, after Hyrum had made 
ready to go — shall it be said to 
the slaughter? yes, for so it was 
— he read the following para- 
graph, near the close of the 
twelfth chapter of Ether, in the 
Book of Mormon, and turned 
down the leaf upon it: 

5. And it came to pass that I 
prayed unto the Lord that he 
would give unto the Gentiles grace, 
that they might have charity. And 
it came to pass that the Lord said 
unto me: If they have not charity 
it mattereth not unto thee, thou 
hast been faithful; wherefore thy 
garments are clean. And because 
thou hast seen thy weakness, thou 
shalt be made strong, even unto the 
sitting down in the place which I 
have prepared in the mansions of 
my Father. And now I . . . . bid 
farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, 
and also unto my brethren whom 
I love, until we shall meet before 
the judgment-seat of Christ, where 
all men shall know that my gar- 
ments are not spotted with your 
blood. The testators are now 
dead, and their testament is in 
force. 



6. Hyrum Smith was forty-four 
years old in February, 1844, and 
Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in 
December, 1843; and hencefor- 
ward their names will be classed 
among the martyrs of religion; 
and the reader in every nation 
will be reminded that the Book 
of Mormon, and this book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants of the church, 
cost the best blood of the nine- 
teenth century to bring them 
forth for the salvation of a ruined 
world; and that if the fire can 
scathe a green tree for the glory 
of God, how easy it will burn up 
the dry trees to purify the vine- 
yard of corruption. They lived 
for glory; they died for glory; 
and glory is their eternal reward. 
From age to age shall their names 
go down to posterity as gems for 
the sanctified. 

7. They were innocent of any 
crime, as they had often been 
proved before, and were only con- 
fined in jail by the conspiracy of 
traitors and wicked men; and 
their innocent blood on the floor 
of Carthage jail is a broad seal 
affixed to "Mormonism" that can- 
not be rejected by any court on 
earth, and their innocent blood on 
the escutcheon of the State of 
Illinois, with the broken faith of 
the State as pledged by the gov- 
ernor, is a witness to the truth of 
the everlasting gospel that all the 
world cannot impeach; and their 
innocent blood on the banner of 
liberty, and on the magna charta 
of the United States, is an am- 
bassador for the religion of Jesus 
Christ, that will touch the hearts 
of honest men among all nations; 
and their innocent blood, with the 
innocent blood of all the martyrs 
under the altar that John saw, 
will cry unto the Lord of Hosts 
till he avenges that blood on the 
earth. Amen.

OFFICIAL DECLARATION 



To Whom it may Concern : 

Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from 
Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that 
the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the 
Interior, allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and 
that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah 
since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses 
the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the 
continuance of the practice of polygamy — 

I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that 
these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural 
marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and 
I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages 
have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any 
other place in the Territory. 

One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the 
marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake 
City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who 



OFFICIAL DECLARATION 257 

performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was 
without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence 
the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without 
delay. 

Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural 
marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the 
court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those 
laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over 
which I preside to have them do likewise. 

There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my 
associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably con- 
strued to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of 
the Church has used language which appeared to convey any such 
teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly de- 
clare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from 
contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land. 

Wilfobd Woodruff 
President of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

President Lorenzo Snow offered the following: 

"I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man 
on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing 
ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his posi- 
tion to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and 
which is dated September 24th, 1890, and that as a Church in Gen- 
eral Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning 
plural mtrriages as authoritative and binding." 

The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous. 

Salt Lake City, Utah, October 6, 1890.
